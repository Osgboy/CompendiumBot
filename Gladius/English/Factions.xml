	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedAdeptusMechanicus" value="The army of the opposing Hereteks is dead or crippled on the fields between our cities. The leaders—Magi, Genetors, Artisans, Logi—have been captured intact and are being escorted to Protoservitor Cradle for mind-wiping. We need material to replace those lost Kataphrons…"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedAstraMilitarum" value="The local Guard divisions have been removed from all equations. We shall reclaim such of our machine spirits and mechanisms that are left intact."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedChaosSpaceMarines" value="Again, we have resisted temptation, fending off the ancient foe. Intriguing combat patterning on the remains of the many-limbed stalker-tanks—what machine spirit could have been deployed to guide such a creature so cleanly, like a living beast? I wonder, does it merit investigation?"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedDrukhari" value="Servitors: burn xenos corpses, acquire heretical technology. Reverse order, of course."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedEldar" value="Degenerate xenos eliminated. Wraithbone ground to powder beneath Kataphron tracks. Webway gates pulled down. I shall crush every spirit stone personally."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedNecrons" value="The Land Crawlers are shunting piles of ancient metal corpses into place. Next we will begin our investigations. Every micrometre of necrodermis will be stripped, every weapon dismantled, all knowledge sent back to Mars for the glory of the Omnissiah."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedOrks" value="Incursion eliminated, vengeance extracted."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedSistersOfBattle" value="We also have faith—but we do not rest on it, rely on it, perform pray for miracles. We build our miracles, little Sisters—we build Knights, Castellans, Titans, our rites ensure their correct functioning, our benedictions awake their machine spirits. And meanwhile, you built shrines, candelabra and graveyards. You will never get to lie in them, for there are none of you left to dig."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="An accounting will have to be made when the Warp Storm subsides, to the High Lords of Terra for the death of another chapter. Yet the arrogance of biological engineering when the machine is available. We would have stripped their skulls and installed sensors, replaced their limbs, given new undying blood to flow in their veins. Perhaps next time…"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedTau" value="Upstart xenos crushed. Of course their devil machines fell to our proven technology. I do wonder, however—how the Omnissiah would regard their concept of the Greater Good? For what purpose are we gathering all this knowledge? Could we persuade their machine spirits to defect? I must ponder this in the reclusiam."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDefeatedTyranids" value="Through the Hab-Fane ducts floats a complex cocktail of chemicals, drifting above abyssal manufactoria and the scuttling mass of humanity. They know it not, but that is all the remains of the Great Devourer—outside, in the blasted fields of Gladius Prime, our Sterylizors are burning the remains, scouring life back to prevent a recurrence of this incursion."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredAdeptusMechanicus" value="Hereteks, here? An offshoot of the Xenarites perhaps, pursuing their own goals, or some secret mission of another Forge World. Little it matters: if they do not fall under the purview of our Magos, we must consider their purposes inimical to our own and facilitate their removal."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="Weak, in flesh and mind. Using great machines, yes, ones built by Mars. Without the support of our forges, without our brothers' and sisters' machines at their side, they are nothing. Their lives are but blades of grass, to be cut by the glorious machines."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredChaosSpaceMarines" value="Heresy, rank heresy. Those who tempted our antecedents on Mars, 10,000 years before, to fall and become less than men. And yet they walk among us today, twisted amalgams of machine and man."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredDrukhari" value="More selfish, more ancient than other Aeldari. Impossibly numerous: calculations of possibility space of non-Euclidean Commorragh exceed entirety of Imperium occupied space. Extreme danger! Ancient technology though, to be desired."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredEldar" value="Selfish, ancient Xenos, these—beware their deceptions and well-meaning chatter. Encoded amongst the blandishments are their own survival above all and the desire to rule the galaxy once more. At least we do not pretend to ethical purposes beyond the God-Emperor’s command."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredNecrons" value="Flesh is weak, metal is strong… but could these ancient Xenos have gone too far? Yes, their alloyed bodies are perfections of construction, heretical, but technically perhaps our own designs. Yet to enter that state they became soulless and now they are beyond the Omnissiah’s—the Emperor’s—redemption."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredOrks" value="Foul Xenos, the greenskins. They create only to destroy. It was their arrival on our world that triggered this catastrophe, that freed our experimental subjects. We shall visit the Omnissiah’s—the Emperor’s—Vengeance upon them."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredSistersOfBattle" value="Quiet, the God-Emperor will hear. Do not talk of the Omnissiah or- Ah, too late. The Ecclesiarchy in extremis becomes as the Inquisition, persecutory. There is no room for our two faiths on this world. And they cannot frustrate our design here, on Gladius Prime."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The Emperor’s finest creation… created before he encountered the Adeptus Mechanicus, of course, and hence beyond our control. See how Cawl, one Tech-Priest alone, far improved on their design. They cannot know of our plans for Gladius Prime—and must not escape…"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredTau" value="Ah, the T’au. Marvellous technologies for such a young race… but what would we have managed with eight thousand years of peace and prosperity? If we dared to vary from the sacred truths of the machine god, of course."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusDiscoveredTyranids" value="Ah, our erstwhile Fecundian experimental subjects, free to wreak havoc again. They are adapting exceptionally to the local climate and opportunities—see the way that Mawloc is consuming a Land Crawler. Perhaps derived from a desert planet variant? Genetor Choen, take notes."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>“Knowledge is the principal thing; therefore get thee knowledge. And in all your getting, get understanding. The Omnissiah directs us to tread the path of wisdom; if anything blocks our way, be it creature, machine or man, we must sacrifice them to the glory of the Machine God and to the Imperium.”<br/>  — Genetor Choen, Forge Mistress<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>You of the Adeptus Mechanicus—the Cult of the Machine God—have worshipped the Omnissiah long before the Imperium came to your world of Mars. Following His edict, you have never doubted or ceased to pursue your calling—to gather knowledge and to employ it to gather more. In pursuit of that, you built the devices and machines that enabled the Imperium to conquer the galaxy 10,000 years ago and maintain it today.<br/><br/>So Gladius Prime was your planet more than it was the Imperium’s—what Hive World was not? Its cities, its satellites, its wastes—all were built with Mars’ technology, all answered only to the Adeptus Mechanicus—that is, to you. It was little effort to hide the Adeptus Mechanicus research into the Tyranids here, in a facility deep beneath the ashen wastes.<br/><br/>Now, however, your facility has been compromised, your Skitarii forces scattered and your subjects have escaped. You must rebuild, recover and take Gladius Prime’s secrets for your own. For you have a mission to fulfil, from the Omnissiah himself…"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusLostFlavor" value="In the interior of Gladius Prime, the last Magos hides, his Skitarii bodyguard twitchy even with emotions suppressed. At this fingertips, the knowledge of a myriad ancient extinct races, the history of the pre-Eldar fall… finally at his grasp. Too late.<br/><br/>Out there in the dark, the Xenos come for him."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusShortFlavor" value="The Adeptus Mechanicus are an empire within the Imperium, with their own agenda, their own god (‘The Omnissiah’) and their own fanatical purpose—the discovery of knowledge, of technology. Though they supply the technical and scientific expertise of the Imperium, they also possess their own elite armies of bionically-augmented soldiers. Xenos or man, stand in their way and they will annihilate you."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusWonEliminationFlavor" value="A victory parade then. Emotionless servitors tramp or roll past. Skitarii with no discernible heads. Magi writhing with mechadendrites. To the surviving population of Gladius Prime, corralled to watch, the Fulgurites are, frankly, a relief, with their howling and captured lightning. Out in the wastes, nothing lives."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusWonQuestFlavor" value="Your mission is fulfilled, the heretek Benedict has been eliminated and Gladius Prime belongs to the Imperium—to the Omnissiah. You walk by its side and marvel at the arcing electricity and Blackstone wreathing your god. (You are dreaming. You are trapped in your head. This can’t be real.)"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum" value="Astra Militarum"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedAdeptusMechanicus" value="As the last Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus falls, their troops lose focus and are easily cut down. Looking at the Skitarii corpses, you cannot but feel sad—these were loyal Imperial soldiers, like you, led by their faith to death at the hands of their peers, when foul Xenos and heretics still threaten the Imperium. Such a waste."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedAstraMilitarum" value="The troops of the traitor Astra Militarum are scattered and leaderless—without the firm command of their heretical leaders, the war is over. Now we must focus our efforts on securing Gladius Prime for the Imperium."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedChaosSpaceMarines" value="The heretics are… dead? From lasgun fire and true grit! The Astra Militarum army celebrates long into the night. In the morning, the Commissar reminds them of the fate of those who are exposed to infectious disease or heresy…"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedDrukhari" value="With the last Kabalite death, with the last piece of last Haemonculus incinerated in a plasma burst, an aura of peace descends on the planet. On the ruins of the hives, the sparbats sing again. It is as if Gladius Prime is thanking you…"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedEldar" value="However many million years of civilisation and learning and here they lie, all that learning lost, dead in the dust of an alien world. It was foul xenos learning anyway, so the better that we took them out of the universe."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedNecrons" value="The green light fades from the last artificial eye, as the last Necron gives up the fight. After immeasurable aeons of war, their cities are crushed, their troops atomised, and their leaders slain. Though beneath the planet's surface, millions more still slumber in deathly unquiet, let's call this a victory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedOrks" value="The Greenskin menace has been defeated. Though that is not to say that it has been eliminated. Even though every Ork, Grot and Snotling is dead, their corpses are already spreading the spores that will raise a new army of Greenskins in a generation. With lasgun, flamer and battle cannon we will be waiting for them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedSistersOfBattle" value="They fought with insane faith and fervour driven on by a living Saint, against men striving to live and fearing the commissar at their back and the artillery overhead. They had bolters and power armour and their God’s blessing, whilst you have lasguns, flak jackets and the contempt of your peers. Yet when the dust cleared, it was the Astra Militarum who still stood."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="The fabled Adeptus Astartes, the legendary warriors of the Imperium, lie dead to a man. No apothecary remains to gather their geneseed for the next generation, no mission from distant Terra can rescue them. The defence of Gladius Prime falls to you—though even if you succeed, the Inquisition will have questions to ask about what happened to the Space Marine Chapter station here…"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedTau" value="They sought to corrupt you, the pathetic xenogens, but they couldn’t persuade a single guardsman. Your machines shall grind their skulls to bonemeal for your fields, melt their machines back to ore—all for the good of mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedTyranids" value="With the death of the last synapse creature, the Tyranids have turned from a horrifying army of synchronised killing, into feral animals. Like the Catachan Devils, these animals are still vicious and deadly, but without co-ordination, they pose no long-term threat to mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredAdeptusMechanicus" value="Tech-Priests, here? Rumours had circulated about the Cult Mechanicus’ secret projects, far out in the ash wastes, and Kastelans have been roving the surface since the Ork invasion—but still to see their mechanically-distorted forms through an omniscope is a surprise. More so when you come under fire from them…"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="You've encountered another group of Imperial Guard, equipped and trained much like your own men. However, they do not respond to your comms and immediately behave in a hostile manner. No matter whether they are traitors, heretics or Xenos pawns, they must be wiped from the face of Gladius."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredChaosSpaceMarines" value="Heretics! The Guardsmen quail in horror. To see these fallen humans isn't only to know that the Emperor was fallible, that his Space Marines could fail—but also to know there is no way that the Imperium will allow the Guardmen to walk away from this. At best, mind-wiping awaits the Astra Militarum, at worst, mass euthanasia."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredDrukhari" value="These Aeldari are… different somehow. Less effete and more capable than the ones we have seen before. Our astropaths report that the aura of these darker Eldar physically repels them, that sadism and horror radiate from their path."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredEldar" value="The fey Aeldari meddle even here, on an Imperial Hive World? They are weak and they are effete and they should have stayed to die of old age on their Craftworld. But if they must come, we will help them die here instead."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredNecrons" value="Necrons, here, on an Imperial world? Who knows how long have they been sleeping beneath the surface, making their inscrutable plans? Your only hope is to overcome them before they wake their sleeping millions and they make this planet theirs once again."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredOrks" value="Meeting Orks is almost a relief for a Guardsman—after all, their behaviour is minutely detailed in The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer and most veterans will have encountered and fought them before. The men that survived generally report that Orks are unhealthily interested in where their next fight is coming from—if you can avoid conflict with them, they will actually weaken over time."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredSistersOfBattle" value="Ah, the trained fanatics of the Ecclesiarchy. By the looks of them they aren’t in mood to talk to their fellow humans, though will certainly sing mournful dirges over your ashen remains. You’d heard that they had a preceptory on this planet—destroy that and their faith will crumble."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The greatest warriors the galaxy has ever known, the Space Marines are committed to rooting out the enemies of mankind wherever they may be, even amongst their allies. This Chapter won't even answer your comms—sadly you must assume that they consider you heretics or traitors, and prepare for war."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredTau" value="If the insidious whispers of heresy weren’t enough, here are xenogen who promise something more than glory and servitude in the name of the Emperor. We have a simple solution to their problem—double the ammunition allocation for each commissar."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredTyranids" value="Through the experiments of Tech-Priests Genetors, the ravening swarm has come to Gladius Prime. But without support from their Hive-Ships, they are not the overwhelming force they have been elsewhere. Perhaps here, Guardsmen alone will be enough to defeat them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>“Though our tanks and artillery are mighty, it is the vast ranks of Imperial Guardsmen that shall trample the enemy to dust—let them come.”<br/>  — Ursarkar E. Creed, Lord Castellan of Cadia<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The Astra Militarum, commonly known as the Imperial Guard, is the primary fighting force of the Imperium of Man. Across a galaxy of a hundred billion stars, there must be billions of Guardsmen at least—yet even the Departmento Munitorum on Terra, which oversees this immense force, has no real idea of how many troops there are at any one time. A safe estimate is to say that there are millions of regiments.<br/><br/>What the Imperial Guard lack in strength, courage and resilience, they make up in numbers, organisation and fighting vehicles—the Guard's wide range of tanks is rightly feared. The manpower of the Astra Militarum is predominantly human, though they do employ stable mutant strains, such as the giant Bullgryns. All these troops are equipped with the best mass-produced weaponry that the Techpriest war manufactories can provide, though it is often backward compared to that wielded by their enemies.<br/><br/>Across the vastness of galactic space, the vast majority of the Imperium's battles involve the Astra Militarum. It is by their actions and endless sacrifice that mankind has claimed and held its place in the universe."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumLostFlavor" value="Deep beneath the Estate Imperium, amidst the city-like bureaucracy that is Terra's Administratum. Here an ancient Servo-skull inches above cluttered, dust-caked shelves, casting light for a shuffling scribe. The scribe finds the archive he is looking for and extracts an ancient dataslate. With a stroke of his stylus he puts a line through Gladius Prime. He pauses for a moment and, in a shaky hand, annotates the entry.<br/><br/>“Gladius Prime: main planet of the Gladius System, Segmentum Obscurus, Ixaniad Sector. Colony lost to warpstorms following the formation of the Cicatrix Maledictum, 999.M41. May the Emperor have mercy on their souls.”"/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumShortFlavor" value="Made up of innumerable billions of soldiers from a million different worlds, the Astra Militarum is, by sheer weight of numbers, the greatest army the galaxy has ever known. They hold nothing less than the survival of humanity in their hands."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonEliminationFlavor" value="The colony has been saved—well, what remains of it. The few remaining Xenos are fleeing to the corners of the planet. Hunting them down should be well within your veterans' capabilities. Truly, you are a war leader to rival Macharius!<br/><br/>With the eventual clearing of the warpstorms, the planet will return to Imperial rule. Rogue Traders will arrive, its cities will be rebuilt, the skulking civilian population will be bolstered by colonists from nearby sectors. Within a generation, it will be a viable colony again, sending its Imperial tithe like any other. Within ten generations, it may be a rich world supplying its own regiment to the Imperium. Within a thousand, it may be a depleted hive world, rife with corruption and filth, a cramped, impoverished home for future humanity. All this, for the glory of mankind—and for the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonQuestFlavor" value="You will never know why the Tech-priest betrayed you and the Imperium, what he was trying to achieve, and what function the artefact on his gun-ship truly served. But with his elimination and the dispersal of the warpstorms, communications have been restored.<br/><br/>Yet the planet's few surviving astropaths have astounding news, straight from Terra itself. Whilst the warp storms shielded your planet, the wider Empire has seen great upheaval. Cadia has fallen, the galaxy has been rent asunder by the warp, and Roboute Guilliman, foremost of the Emperor's Primarchs, has awoken from his ten thousand-year slumber.<br/><br/>Despite this, your army will not be joining Guilliman's crusades. Gladius Prime's unique artefacts and strategic location mean you have been permanently assigned here—to protect the planet and the explorators, come what may."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDefeatedAdeptusMechanicus" value="A pity. Though there was glory in your deaths, little Priests, we could have been so much more together. A Dark Mechanicum standing with us in the Dark Imperium, Warpsmiths and Hereteks and Xenarites and Savants, new discoveries in the name of our masters in the Immaterium. But you spurned our gift and foolishly fought to the last and that dream is dust."/>

In their new immortal form, they took on the then-masters of the galaxy—the Old Ones—and in aeons-long battle they defeated them. In their desperation, the Old Ones seeded the galaxy with psychic races, thus awakening the horrors of the warp, and the Necrons—weakened by a simultaneous battle of liberation from the C'tan—retreated to their homeworlds.<br/><br/>There, falling into hibernation, they slumbered for untold time. As other races were born and drove themselves to extinction, they lay deep and undisturbed in multitudinous worlds, tended and defended in their not-sleep by their monstrous Canoptek automata.<br/><br/>Now, across the galaxy, they are awakening. Even here, this Crownworld's master circuits are stirring. The Necrons—now unthinking machines, save for their few Lords and Triarchs—are arming themselves for war again.

Heavily-muscled, aggressive, eight-foot-tall fungal thugs with a love of warfare, the Orks were a spacefaring peril long before the human Imperium entered the galactic scene. Spread evenly across the galaxy, for the most part they are an irritant to any other inhabitants, like lazy, belligerent neighbours. But occasionally, as a swarm of locusts, the scattered tribes and clans form into a Waaagh!—something between a crusade and a riot—and devastate entire sectors until they run out of things to fight and fall instead into internecine warfare.<br/><br/>That's not to say the Orks are completely primitive. Despite their thuggish demeanour, they possess a low intelligence augmented by genetically-coded technical excellence. Their technicians—called Meks—build raggedy, ugly vehicles, buildings, guns and spaceships, which should fall apart at first use, but actually perform their job surprisingly effectively. Imperial scholars believe this is due to the pervasive psychic power of the Orks, which simply fills in the technical gaps that should prevent all their devices from working.<br/><br/>In battle, Orks attacks are undisciplined rampages, full of boisterous chanting and joy of warfare. Their crude weapons and blunt tactics mingled with their resilience and sheer numbers make them a dangerous foe. Even when defeated, their bodies spread spores which, in time, will grow into more Orks, plus their servant races—Grots, Squigs and Snots—which keep them alive. Even when every last Ork is dead, the Orks are far from defeated."/>

There is no escape from this final embrace and when the Tyranids finally depart, they leave behind a barren world, a scoured ball of rock now devoid of anything that lives.<br/><br/>A Tyranid hive fleet consists of millions of living starcraft, each home to untold numbers of monstrosities evolved from the geno-organs of the ship's reproductive chambers. All the creatures serve the entity that is the ship, and the ship exists only as part of the horrific super-organism that is the fleet. Even when dead, organic matter is reconstituted back into the ship, along with captured biomass from the invaded planet. It is then all dissolved into a rich biological gruel used to make new Tyranid creatures, each ready to serve the Hive Mind and begin the feeding process anew.<br/><br/>But on Gladius, the Tyranids are few and scattered, brought here by meddling men. The warp storms keep them distant from the will of the Hive Mind and the Imperial citizens think of them merely as pests. They should worry more…"/>
	<entry name="TyranidsLostFlavor" value="The Hive Mind would not consider this a defeat. A small loss of biomass, yes, a tendril vanished of its myriad remaining in the darkness between the stars. But to experience defeat the Hive Mind would have to recognise a foe—and in the solipsistic universe of a galaxy-spanning mind nothing has yet proven itself worthy, save for lost fragments of itself. Pity the Tyranid, who cannot know victory, who knows not what it has lost."/>

	<entry name="TyranidsShortFlavor" value="Of all the races in the 41st Millennium, the Tyranids are the most alien. Each Tyranid is a living weapon, a creature perfectly designed to fulfil its role. Driven by the gestalt consciousness of the Hive Mind, the Tyranids overwhelm their prey with weight of numbers. Those that are not swept aside under a tide of razor-sharp claws and lethal bio-weaponry fire are smashed asunder by gigantic alien monsters the size of battle tanks."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsWonEliminationFlavor" value="Every piece of biomass, every atom of air, the rocks of the planet's surface, all have been harvested. Still, the planet fights the swarm, burning it, crushing it, subjecting it to the horrors of the warp, and each time the swarm rebuilds, with less biomass than before. The swarm has won—but it remains trapped beneath Gladius' ancient defences, a swarm of ants beneath glass, tormented by the mechanisms of long-dead gods."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsWonQuestFlavor" value="When the Explorator ships finally reached Gladius Prime, generations later, to see if anything was left to be reclaimed, the planet itself had gone. Instead, around the sun called Gladius was a metallic asteroid belt in the same orbit. And, of course, the Tyranids were long gone…"/>
