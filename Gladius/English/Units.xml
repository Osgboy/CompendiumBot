Their quest is to locate the Motive Force that animates all things, rip it from the bodies of the unworthy in the heat of battle, and hoard it on behalf of the Machine God. To do so they use electroleech staves – eldritch weapons that suck the bioelectricity from living creatures, drawing it out in one great draught and harnessing it within their core capacitors. Once stolen, that sacred energy can be used to power the holy instead of the heretical, crackling around them in such measure it can even burn away incoming projectiles."/>

In battle Kataphron Breachers rumble forward at the command of their Tech-Priest masters, fulfilling the role of living shield and battering ram alike.

From its avenger gatling cannon it levels a fusillade of heavy shells, sketching deadly patterns across the enemy army’s frontage. Those that are equipped with Icarus autocannons on their shoulders are given an additional duty: to protect their comrades from airborne attack. Swivelling in response to their predictive auto-auguries, the Icarus cannons spit streams of flak fire into the skies to detonate enemy aircraft in distant fireballs.

These unstoppable cyborgs do not rest until the bloody deed is done, for they are driven ever onward by the imperative to locate their foes and ensure their destruction. They do this not in Drop Pod strikes launched from above, nor by sudden teleportation into the midst of the enemy, but by stalking their quarry over the course of weeks or even months until it can run no more. Once the designated target is in their crosshairs the air fills with the thump and crackle of galvanic weaponry, even as the Skitarii continue their relentless advance.

Warp energy sizzles from his eyes, and black flames curl from his mouth as he speaks dread phrases that kill as sure as any blade. These are creatures of nightmare—a living expression of Chaos given form."/>

The Defiler's crab-like body supports a daemonic torso that carries an array of deadly weaponry, ranging from reaper autocannons to racks of highly explosive missiles. It is the battle cannon mounted in its chest turret, however, that is undoubtedly its most potent armament.

The power of life he delivers to the ghost warriors of the craftworlds, not only by placing the spirit stones that animate them within their wraithbone shells, but by using his psychic powers to enhance and invigorate them during battle. The gift of death he brings to those who threaten the craftworld. A simple gesture from a Spiritseer can see his enemies assailed by lithe, powerful constructs that are all but indestructible, each immortal hero burning with a cold malevolence from beyond the grave."/>

This unique technology means that, though no more than mindless drones, Canoptek Wraiths have manifold uses in war. Fortifications are no obstacle to a Wraith, and they are able to pass more or less undetected even through the midst of the foe, making them exceptional spies and assassins both. Furthermore, Canoptek Wraiths make effective terror-troops, appearing as if from nowhere to strike at vital targets in the enemy’s midst.

Ghost Arks are often used as conventional transports that ferry reinforcements into battle – however, they truly come into their own once their grim cargo has disembarked.

As it ploughs through the enemy ranks, the Daemon Engine wields its roaring cleaver with a speed and skill that is entirely horrifying in something so huge. Entire ranks of enemy warriors are swept away with a single swing, tanks and monstrous beasts swatted through the air like toys. Even towering war engines such as Stompas or Titans are made to look clumsy and sluggish as the Lord of Skulls hacks off their limbs and tears open their armoured torsos amid blossoms of dirty flame. Few warriors can face the Lord of Skulls and live, for it is a machine of absolute destruction."/>

Though other Orks mock the Meganobz for wearing so much armour, only the dullest would do so within earshot.

The MV5 Stealth Drone is one such, carrying a stealth field generator and only ever deployed in pairs alongside the rare XV95 Ghostkeel Battlesuit. Given how long these infiltrators spend alone behind enemy lines, Ghostkeel pilots typically develop a strong relationship with their MV5s and Battlesuit."/>

	<entry name="Tau/StormsurgeDescription" value="Gargantuan creature with phenomenal firepower that is equally lethal in attack and defence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/StormsurgeFlavor" value="The earth shakes with the approach of the towering KV128 Stormsurge. Mag-lifted into battle by modified Manta Missile Destroyers, these titanic walking tanks serve as mobile strongpoints with enough firepower to obliterate entire formations of the foe. Once he has the enemy in his sights, the Stormsurge's pilot fires stabilising anchors, locking the enormous ballistic suit to the ground while the gunner diverts all power to its apocalyptic arsenal of weaponry."/>
	<entry name="Tau/SunSharkBomber" value="AX39 Sun Shark Bomber"/>
	<entry name="Tau/SunSharkBomberDescription" value="Flying bomber unit that auto-marks enemies for increased damage and deploys interceptor drones."/>
	<entry name="Tau/SunSharkBomberFlavor" value="As the Sun Shark bomber soars into battle, its pulse bomb generator flares to life, the charge glowing brighter and brighter until it sears the eyes like a miniature star. Guided by holosuite targeters, the Sun Shark's pilot grimly holds his course through a hail of enemy flak, waiting to discharge his pulse bomb at the optimum moment. Even as the Sun Shark peels away into the clouds once more, a vast fireball engulfs the enemy below, the blazing flare erasing those who will not embrace the Greater Good."/>

	<entry name="Tau/TidewallGunrigDescription" value="Heavily armed fortification that can be moved by transporting troops."/>
	<entry name="Tau/TidewallGunrigFlavor" value="With its in-built rail weaponry, the Tidewall Gunrig provides the firepower to deal with heavy enemy assault units or advancing ranks of armour. Manned by hard-eyed Fire Warriors, these mobile turrets mount devastating railguns that are more than capable of ripping apart enemy tanks or monstrous beasts with volleys of hyper-sonic rounds."/>
	<entry name="Tau/TigerShark" value="Tiger Shark"/>
	<entry name="Tau/TigerSharkDescription" value="Flying super-heavy fighter-bomber unit equipped with maximum firepower."/>
	<entry name="Tau/TigerSharkFlavor" value="The Tiger Shark is a large aircraft deployed in a fighter bomber role. Often encountered flying in support of T'au Hunter cadres during major operations, the Tiger Shark's main role appears to be the deployment of drones although, more recently, those armed with multiple seeker missiles have also been encountered. Efforts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to recover damaged Tiger Shark craft from battlefields have been met by fierce resistance by T'au Empire forces, as well as by certain elements of the Inquisition."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Biovore" value="Biovores"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/BiovoreDescription" value="Artillery unit that creates Spore Mines which explode on contact with the enemy."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/BiovoreFlavor" value="A Biovore is a squat, bloated creature—yet no less deadly for all that. Deep within its lumpen form, the Biovore nurtures a clutch of Spore Mines—living bombs that blanket the enemy in acids, poisons and shrapnel-sized pieces of chitin. Biovores thump forward in battle, bony protrusions on their fore-limbs anchoring themselves into the ground as they release their vile payload in a single shuddering spasm."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Carnifex" value="Carnifex"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/CarnifexDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit with devastating close combat capabilities."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/CarnifexFlavor" value="Carnifexes are living engines of destruction, towering monsters of unyielding armoured chitin and knotted alien musculature. They are one of the toughest and deadliest of all a hive fleet's warrior creatures, created to spearhead assaults in massed battles. Though the Hive Mind has since created larger warrior-organisms, few are the Carnifex's equal in terms of size to strength, nor in terms of sheer destructive potential."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Doom" value="The Doom"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/DoomDescription" value=""/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/DoomFlavor" value="The Doom appears to be a one-off creation of the Hive Mind, produced with great difficulty. It is a unique vampiric Zoanthrope, that feeds upon psychic energy. Over its skull sits a long, spine-like growth like a hood and vestigial claws emerge like ribs from its side. Psychic energy can be visibly seen crackling along these structures. In combat, it uses them to focus its psychic powers and draw all the life-energy from its surroundings. A similar creature is thought to have singlehandedly destroyed the Aeldari Craftworld of Malan'tai by devouring the spirits from its Infinity Circuits."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/ExocrineDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit that excels when stationary."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ExocrineFlavor" value="Exocrines are feared for their ability to deal death from afar. The most distinctive feature of an Exocrine is its dorsal bio-cannon, which emits a high-pitched hiss a second before firing, giving its prey just enough time to realise the danger they are in before searing plasma scours them into atoms."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Gargoyle" value="Gargoyles"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/GargoyleDescription" value="Jump infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/GargoyleFlavor" value="A Tyranid attack is preceded by the beating of thousands of membranous wings as Gargoyle broods descend upon the foe, blotting out the sun and spitting death from their fleshborers. Their winged manoeuvrability gives Gargoyles a distinct hunting advantage. Wherever Tyranids attack a planet, the defenders look fearfully to the skies, for they know that every sky-borne shadow could be a flock of Gargoyles about to attack."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/HaruspexDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit with a grasping tongue."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HaruspexFlavor" value="The Tyranid Haruspex is a ferocious beast created to consume biomass at a sickening pace. It is possessed of a rapacious appetite, driven by the need to sate an infinite hunger. Few foes are foolish enough to stand before a feeding Haruspex, for it can devour an entire platoon of soldiers in a matter of moments, shovelling victim after victim into its craw without ever slowing down. Any morsel that proves too large to be swallowed in one gulp is seized with the Haruspex's gargantuan claws and ripped, crushed or battered apart with negligent ease."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/HiveCroneFlavor" value="The Hive Crone is a flying monstrosity used by the Tyranids to establish air superiority over prey worlds. It is a creature perfectly adapted to aerial combat, able to wrestle enemy aircraft out of the skies as proficiently as any daredevil pilot at the controls of a sophisticated jet-fighter."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HiveGuard" value="Hive Guards"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HiveGuardDescription" value="Tough ranged infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HiveGuardFlavor" value="Hive Guard are heavily armoured gun-beasts bound to extremely powerful symbiotic bio-weapons. Though they have no eyes, Hive Guard possess a weak telepathic ability that allows them to perceive through the senses of other Tyranids, giving them access to a wealth of targeting information that would overwhelm even the most sophisticated technological cogitator. The scant mental capacity apportioned to the Hive Guard means that, without the direction of the Hive Mind, they have been known to stand motionless, waiting for prey to come within range instead of moving forwards to engage."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/HiveTyrantFlavor" value="Hive Tyrants are the commanders of the Tyranid swarms and enact the Hive Mind's will on the field of battle. Though individuals display a wide variety of physical characteristics, all Hive Tyrants are fearsome hulking monsters that tower over even a Dreadnought. They are brutally strong, able to shatter ferrocrete with sickening ease. Every part of such a beast's body is perfectly created to kill, even the layers of chitinous plating that protect them. A Hive Tyrant is a formidable opponent at any distance, as deadly with ranged weapons as it is with bonesword or claw."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/HormagauntDescription" value="Basic close combat infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HormagauntFlavor" value="Hormagaunts are vicious and extraordinarily single-minded predators that will pursue their victims without pause or respite. With powerful hind legs, Hormagaunts dart across the battlefield in a series of bounding leaps, ignoring injury and tiredness until they have run down their exhausted quarry and torn it apart with frenzied strikes of their scythe-like claws."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/LictorDescription" value="Stealth infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/LictorFlavor" value="The Lictor is a highly specialised development of the Tyranid Warrior bioform, specifically adapted to fill a scout role in the vanguard of the Tyranid advance. Lictors rove ahead of the main body of a swarm, seeking out pockets of resistance to be eradicated and native life forms to be absorbed. Able to move swiftly and without sound through even the densest terrain, and concealed by a chameleonic carapace that renders it all but invisible to the naked eye, a Lictor can remain hidden until it chooses to strike. It can wait motionless for days, unnoticed by its victims, an unseen herald of approaching disaster."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Malanthrope" value="Malanthrope"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/MalanthropeDescription" value="Support unit that consumes tiles and founds new cities."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/MalanthropeFlavor" value="Malanthropes are rarely seen Tyranid creatures. This is because they are not truly warrior organisms, and so are not usually encountered by a prey world's defenders. Instead, these floating creatures follow behind the Tyranid attack; they are typically created only after a prey world's protectors have been defeated and the swarm is in the process of devouring the planet's biomass. On those few occasions that a survivor has seen a Malanthrope and somehow escaped, they have brought with them a tale of horror. They report seeing these giants drift across corpse-strewn battlefields, but unlike other Tyranids, which mindlessly devour everything in their way, Malanthropes seem to selectively search through the slain—as to what they are searching for, none can say."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Ravener" value="Raveners"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerDescription" value="Fast beast unit bred for close combat."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerFlavor" value="Raveners are voracious predators, their clawed and snake-like bodies driven onwards by an all-consuming hunger. Twisted musculature grants these beasts a terrifying turn of speed. Raveners can bound over small obstacles in an eye-blink, dart between larger obstructions and even slither through flooded marshland with bewildering swiftness. The power housed within the Raveners' wiry forms allows them to burrow long distances beneath a world's surface, before emerging in a spray of earth right in front of an enemy position, claws eviscerating their ambushed prey whilst their thorax-mounted weapon symbiotes spit death."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHierodule" value="Scythed Hierodule"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHieroduleDescription" value="Agile gargantuan creature unit that shreds entire armies."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHieroduleFlavor" value="The Scythed Hierodule was first recorded during the invasion of Hamman's World, a small Imperial colony close to one of the tendrils of Hive Fleet Kraken. Hamman's World was attacked soon after Kraken's defeat on Ichar IV as the hive fleet began to splinter. Nothing like the Hierodule has ever been reported before. It is armed with four huge razor-sharp claws, each capable of slicing clean through a battle tank, and heavily protected by chitin plates, in places up to 30 cm thick. A Hierodule is far larger than a Carnifex and is a monstrous-killing machine, even by Tyranid standards."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantDescription" value="Basic infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantFlavor" value="Termagants are agile and cunning creatures. They are amongst the smallest of the Hive Mind's warriors and were originally created to roam the arterial passages of bio-ships in search of intruders. In planetary invasions, Termagants scuttle forwards on four legs whilst unleashing torrents of fire from the anti-personnel bio-weaponry—commonly fleshborers—clutched in their clawed forelimbs."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tervigon" value="Tervigon"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TervigonDescription" value="Synapse hero unit that spawns armies of Termagants."/>

Though possessed of a formidable array of bio-weapons, from monstrous claws that crush any prey that ventures too close, to banks of razor-tipped spines that can be fired a considerable distance, the Tervigon's true threat lies within… Every Tervigon serves as a living incubator, within whose bloated form dozens upon dozens of Termagants slumber in a state of near-life. The Tervigon can spawn its dormant broods at will, jolting their minds into wakefulness."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Trygon" value="Trygon"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit that can build Broodhives to initiate subterranean assaults."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonFlavor" value="The Trygon is a vast serpentine creature, so colossal that it towers over even the mighty Carnifex. It is a heavily armoured monster, covered from head to tail with a thick carapace of shifting plates. As the Trygon moves, these plates generate a potent bio-static charge that courses along the length of the beast's body and wreathes its bladed forelimbs with crackling power. The Trygon can direct this energy as a lethal high-voltage discharge—unleashing pulsing arcs of lightning that leave its prey as little more than a charred pile of scorched bones."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/TunnelFlavor" value="Where the Tyranids arrive, the plants that constitute the Broodhive travel with them.

	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannocyteDescription" value="Monstrous creature that transports units to the frontline and supports them by pinning down enemy units."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannocyteFlavor" value="Normally acting as organic drop pods discharged from orbiting Hive Ships, Tyrannocytes have been adapted by the Gladius Prime Hive Mind, isolated as it is by warp storms. Here they act as lumbering floating transports, carrying creatures as large as Carnifexes and protecting them until close to the enemy. Then the Tyrannocyte’s gravid belly opens, disgorging their monstrous cargo, whilst it assaults the enemy with endless barbed stranglers…"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tyrannofex" value="Tyrannofex"/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannofexFlavor" value="There can be little doubt that the massive Tyrannofex exists purely for destruction—it is a monster created for the most apocalyptic and gruelling of battlegrounds. Striding ominously towards their prey, these alien giants deal death from afar, shattering enemy battle lines with merciless salvos of bio-weapons fire. The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance. Clad in ablative layers of chitinous armour, a Tyrannofex is as unyielding as any war engine built of steel or born of conventional technology."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Venomthrope" value="Venomthropes"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VenomthropeDescription" value="Infantry unit with poisonous attacks and a protective spore cloud."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VenomthropeFlavor" value="The Venomthrope serves as a living chemical weapon dispenser for the swarms of the Tyranid hive fleets. Its whip-like tentacles drip with a multitude of alien poisons. Indeed, so potent are these toxins that it is believed that a Venomthrope's very touch means certain death."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorDescription" value="Versatile synapse infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorFlavor" value="Tyranid Warriors are the most adaptable of all the Hive Mind's bioforms. They are creatures from the blackest of nightmares, unstoppable killing machines with pulsing ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and darkly gleaming eyes that reveal a terrible intelligence at work. A Tyranid Warrior stands twice the height of a man, its carapace protected by a thick chitin. One might expect such a creature to be slow in its actions, but a Tyranid Warrior is lithe, with reactions as swift as a whip."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Zoanthrope" value="Zoanthropes"/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/ZoanthropeFlavor" value="Zoanthropes are created solely to harness the psychic potential of the Hive Mind, and their entire bodies are perfected towards such a function. If necessary, a Zoanthrope can be used to extend the range of the Hive Mind's synaptic control, utilising the beast's vast cerebral capacity to relay its instructions to lesser creatures. A Zoanthrope's link to the synaptic web is such that, by flexing the merest part of its mind, it can rain incandescent power on the enemy, projecting destructive bolts of energy that boils through adamantium plate and disintegrates flesh with equal ease."/>
