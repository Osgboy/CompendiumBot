	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/AircraftFlavor" value="An Archaeoptera is just yet another Adeptus Mechanicus construction facility, albeit for flying machines rather than terrestrial. It has all the usual elements—the massed slave labour to build the machines, the medical facilities for all the amputations the pilots need to fit in, and the shrines to conduct the proper rituals over the Transvectors and Stratoraptors. In other words, a totally normal Tech-Priest manufactorum."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates food, ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/ConstructionFlavor" value="The simple title of ‘artisan’ conceals the immensity of what these Tech-Priests achieve. Not personally, of course, but through vast labour forces of mind-wiped servitors. Here, in the Constructorum, this army of once-men build the buildings and tools to enable the Tech-Priest’s efforts elsewhere."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/EnergyFlavor" value="After millennia of inhabitation, Gladius Prime is a trove of ancient technology, much active and embedded deep in its crust. Alongside that, the planet’s core is still active with roiling magma. The Thermo-Exchanger Shrines use arcane technology and ritual to tap the planet’s restless heaving and gather that energy for use elsewhere."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/FoodFlavor" value="The Adeptus Mechanicus are not famed for their love of the pleasures of the flesh and it is a rare Tech-Priest who would admit to being a gourmet of anything but code. That is reflected in these repurposed Ferratonic Furnaces, or rather their dietary output. Its rations are calibrated to be the most efficient medium for transferring the absolute minimum energy and resources for an average person to survive and function."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/LoyaltyFlavor" value="Of course, there is dissent in the Imperium. Even in the Adeptus Mechanicus, hidebound as it is, there is disagreement over the best path to follow. And this is all productive, useful discord. For were there not heretics, there would not the requisite human raw materials to produce servitors and servo-skulls, to set up as examples to craven humanity as to what happens to those who stray from the Omnissiah’s Path."/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The Forge Temple is the centre of the Adeptus Mechanicus’ presence on a world. Is it a citadel of information, a repository of the remnants of humanity’s long-cherished knowledge… or the headquarters of a fanatical cult dedicated to hoarding information that could save humanity? To even think the latter would, of course, be heresy…"/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces tech-priests as well as increases population limit and loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HeroesFlavor" value="A Sub-Cloister serves as a shelter and school for new Tech-Priests. Here, promising acolytes from the planet’s hive cities are trained in the many secrets of the Cult Mechanicus. Over time, if they survive, they find their calling, emerging as lowly Enginseers, fanatical Electro-Priests, cybernetic Data-Smiths or any of a myriad other non-combat specialisations."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Housing" value="Hab Fane"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/HousingFlavor" value="It is hard to think of an alien race that might approve of a Hive World’s living conditions—perhaps the subterranean Hrud. Yet to the Adeptus Mechanicus, they are ideal. They seek to replicate their efficiency in their own housing units, cramming workers, servitors and skitarii into living quarters so tight that violence would seem assured—were it not for behavioural engineering and surgery."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Infantry" value="Genetor Caropraedium"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as generates food, ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/InfantryFlavor" value="To say that the Astra Militarum training academies ‘produce’ soldiers would offend any Tech-Priest’s logic centres. Even the lowliest acolyte knows that humans are just one raw material in the production of effective soldiers, with circuits, bio-plastic and metal comprising a larger proportion of most Skitarii. After all, “flesh is fallible”!"/>

	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/InfluenceFlavor" value="To anyone else, it is machine noise—whirring and beeping and grinding. But to the receptors of an augmented Adeptus Mechanicus subject, it is a combination of choral evensong, elegant symphony and fervent prayer to the glory of the Omnissiah and the rightness of His servants, the Adeptus Mechanicus."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Ore" value="Haemotrope Reactor"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/OreFlavor" value="This complicated installation is understood fully by few Tech-Priests, but can be repurposed to many functions. In the absence of Adeptus Administratum manpower, to physically extract the ore, the Adeptus Mechanicus falls back on approved ancient techniques—retargetting the Reactor’s plasma output onto ore veins to extract and refine the metals they contain."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Research" value="Librarium Omnis"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/ResearchFlavor" value="Named in honour of the continent-spanning data repository buried beneath the surface of Mars, each local Librarium contains a tiny fraction of the surviving knowledge of mankind, much of which was disordered or corrupted during the Schism of Mars. Many Tech-Priests dedicate their lives (and lose them) exploring these secrets in the hope of rediscovering ancient knowledge or even—Omnissiah willing—an STC."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Vehicles" value="Manufactorum Cybernetica"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates food, ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/VehiclesFlavor" value="A Tech-Priest manufactorum is leagues ahead of its standard Imperial equivalent. Not technologically, of course—the Cult Mechanicus considers it more important to safeguard the technology they have and improving it is a Xenarite heresy that only Cawl himself might consider. Instead this building has superior rituals, unguents, chants, libations and so forth."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Aircraft" value="Voidport"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces aircraft as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/AircraftFlavor" value="This landing field was designed for larger craft—almost up to the intra-system scale—but with the endless warpstorms, it's been repurposed to house the Imperial air forces. Much like a Skyshield landing pad, it has limited field generators to protect grounded aircraft from incoming fire."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Construction" value="Labour Corps"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates food and research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionFlavor" value="Whilst the Administratum runs the entire Empire of man, the Departmento Munitorum is tasked solely with supplying the manpower and supplies for the Astra Militarum. Among their many tasks is the construction of large facilities, such as airfields or orbital stations. The poor grunts who have to do the work are the Labour Corps, indentured or penal workers and mind-wiped servitors."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Energy" value="Plasma Ioniser"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyFlavor" value="Whilst the ancients may have split the atom, the Empire's Techpriests have had millennia to perfect the rituals by which they draw up power. The open-core Plasma Ioniser uses coolant-infusion systems to maintain an output of around 100 petawatts for up to a hundred days at a time—around 10,000 times that of the largest historical fission plant."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Food" value="Soylens Farm"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodFlavor" value="Soylens viridians might be filling, nutritious and easy to grow in great vats—but as a foodstuff it has some drawbacks. First, it's utterly bland and flavourless. Second, it looks like green gloop. Third, it's made from any available organic matter. Persistent rumour has it that human corpses are not excluded."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Loyalty" value="Sanctum Imperialis"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyFlavor" value="The local seat of the Imperial Cult may appear dark and gothic, but is in fact a hallowed place. Adorned by statues of saints, it is a venerated local symbol of the Emperor's godlike will, and provides inspiration to the nearby populace."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Headquarters" value="Basilica Administratum"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The central administrative building of any Imperial colony, the magnificent Basilica is a temple to bureaucracy. Generations of plain-clad clerks live and die amidst tottering tomes, deciding the fate of star systems with the feeble thump of their stamps. As the saying goes, the Inquisition may burn you, the Astartes smite you—but only the Adeptus Administratum can torment you for your entire life."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Heroes" value="Shrine of the Aquila"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesFlavor" value="Far more than a mere statue, this great metal eagle was cast from the molten remains of space-faring vessels, and serves as an inspiration for those nearby. The Imperial troops that fight under the Aquila's ceaseless vigil find a new determination welling in their hearts, knowing that they are the last in a line of heroes that stretches across the stars."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Housing" value="Hab Block"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingFlavor" value="The classic Imperial structure, these identikit city buildings are seen all over the Empire. They provide the minimum amount of shelter and comfort required for the people of the Imperium to eke out their short lives. At a colony's founding, sometimes they're built in situ—but more often, on remote planets, they're dropped directly from any colonising spaceships."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Infantry" value="Imperial Barracks"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as increases population limit and generates food."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryFlavor" value="Whilst the training of recruits to the Imperial Guard has none of the harrowing horrors suffered by Astartes initiates, the Munitorum still has to drill the strictures of the Empire into the tithed men and women that make up most Guard regiments. Here, at the Barracks, a planet's unpromising conscripts are turned into the true Astra Militarum—by giving them uniforms, guns and perhaps even some training."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Influence" value="Cogitator Station"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceFlavor" value="Though artificial intelligence is an abomination, long abhorred since the fall of the Men of Iron, the archaic data looms of the Adeptus Administratum bear little resemblance to ancient computers or even to the slim microprocessors used by the Techpriests of Mars. Cogitators functions are purely bureaucratic, their form immobile. Still, their capabilities are prized by every Imperial world purely for their inhuman memory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Ore" value="Ore Extractor"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreFlavor" value="Depending on the planet, extraction of metal ores and valuable minerals is undertaken by anything ranging from ancient-tech machinery barely controlled by its Techpriest magos to thousands of Labour Corp workers, playing their part in the war to save mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Psykers" value="Psyker Coven"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersDescription" value="Building that produces psykers as well as generates energy and influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersFlavor" value="Whilst the warpstorm rages, the peacetime use of psykers—as astropaths, for long-range communication—is pointless. Similarly, without being able to reach the Black Ships, unwanted psykers can't be transported to Terra for sacrifice at the Golden Throne. Instead, most are executed, with a select few drafted into Imperial service as Sanctioned Psykers."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Research" value="Officio Tactica"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchFlavor" value="Learning to be an officer of the Astra Militarum is a thankless, often lethal task. One of the safest postings is to the Officio Tactica, where the smartest tactical minds analyse ongoing military manouevres and refer to the copious texts of the Tactica Imperialis for well-tested advice. They also record their current campaigns, so that future generations might learn from them."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesDescription" value="Building that produces Techpriest Enginseers and generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesFlavor" value="The Techpriests worship of 'the Omnissiah', a machine-god, would surely be frowned upon, were it not for their usefulness. Instead, a tacit agreement is in place; the Techpriests acknowledge publicly that the Emperor was the Omnissiah and the Administratum agrees not to pry too closely."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesFlavor" value="To call an Imperial Manufactorum a 'factory' is akin to calling a Catachan Devil an insect. These cyclopean structures are huge, forbidding temples to the Machine God, wherein his miracles—here vehicles of war—are created. Inside them, lowly menials are doomed to never see the planet's surface, as they ceaselessly minister to the blessed engines of Mars."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/AircraftFlavor" value="10,000 years ago the Heldrakes were fighter craft, piloted by the cream of the Adeptus Astartes. Now, they are hideous amalgams of man and machine, formed by millennia of war into dragon-like creatures that live to fight. This artificial eyrie allows the Warpsmiths and Master of Possession to monitor the Heldrakes and even attempt to replicate their age-old creation."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ConstructionFlavor" value="Though the Warpsmiths’ Soul Forges are deep in the Realm of Chaos and hence inaccessible from Gladius, Chaos is nothing if not flexible.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/CultFlavor" value="What are gods without followers? Here, Cultists and Dark Apostles alike plot to bring converts to the worship of Chaos—not a hard task on Gladius, once people see the inhuman Xenos, the undoubted effects of the Dark Gods’ powers, and the Daemonic shapes lingering in the chancel."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/EnergyFlavor" value="The fallen Techpriests of Chaos—now the Warpsmiths of the Dark Mechanicum—have had ten thousand years of calibrating their devices beyond the strictures of the Omnissiah. As powerful as a conventional Plasma Generator, this power source can be constructed quickly in situ. Its demon spirit draws energy from the flickering of a tear into the Empyrean to charge an infernal motion device."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/FoodFlavor" value="Your troops are mostly beyond mortal desires—but the beastmen, mutants and slaves who run your cities aren’t. To provide food for them, bodies of all sorts are brought to the rendering stations, to provide pleasure for the Slaaneshi degenerates who run them and food for the massed workers—the stronger ones, at least. The weaker ones are dinner."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/LoyaltyFlavor" value="It can’t have been a follower of Khorne who named this plain a ‘meadow’—allegory isn’t a concomitant of the Blood God’s troops.

But the Slaaneshi garden these fields, constantly devising unholy pleasures for their God’s honour at the expense of its victims."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HeadquartersFlavor" value="Even ten thousand years of heresy hasn’t entirely eliminated a Traitor’s training.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HousingFlavor" value="Of all the gods, only Father Nurgle seems to care for his worshippers.

Looking at the Daemons of each God—the giggling Horrors, the droning Plaguebearers, the raging Bloodletters, the gasping Daemonettes— nothing could be more dissimilar.

In its richness, they say, it rivals the Aeldari’s Black Library or the meaningless infinity of the Library of Babel.

	<entry name="SpaceMarines/HousingFlavor" value="Though each Battle-Brother receives his own personal cell, those members of a Chapter who do not directly enforce the will of the Emperor share communal quarters spread across the fortress-monastery. Support staff including servants, nurses and technicians call these stark dormitories home."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Infantry" value="Apothecarion"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as increases population limit and generates research."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/InfantryFlavor" value="The Apothecarion provides medical support for wounded Battle-Brothers, and plays a vital role in the elevation of an Aspirant to a Space Marine. Both these functions pale into insignificance against the Apothecarion's other purpose—the preservation of its Chapter's unique gene-seed, from which new Space Marines are created. If the gene-seed is lost, so too is the Chapter."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Influence" value="Assimularum"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/InfluenceFlavor" value="An immense and high-ceilinged gathering-place, wherein every member of the Chapter may assemble to attend briefings, ceremonies and even feasts of particular import. In most fortress-monasteries, the Great Hall is the only room to exceed the sheer size of the Assimularum."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Loyalty" value="Company Chapel"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/LoyaltyFlavor" value="Here the Chaplains tend to the spiritual well-being of their charges, ensuring the discipline of every Marine and keeping their minds and spirits pure. In order to accommodate this, each of the Chapter's ten Companies has its own dedicated chapel. Greater ceremonies take place in the Reclusiam itself."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Requisitions" value="Refectory"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/RequisitionsDescription" value="Building that generates requisitions."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/RequisitionsFlavor" value="The Chapter's mammoth dining halls and kitchens are contained within its Refectories. The Space Marine diet is a spartan affair, augmented with a cocktail of bio-chemical supplements to ensure constant battle-readiness. The Battle-Brothers consume this repast in complete silence."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Research" value="Librarium"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/ResearchFlavor" value="Though also a store for extensive written histories of its Chapter, the Librarium is first and foremost its central command, communications and defence station. Here, Astropaths manage external and intra-base comms, while Librarians and psykers pore over, protect and update the Chapter's centuries of wisdom."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Vehicles" value="Armoury"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates requisitions and research."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/VehiclesFlavor" value="Home to anything that a Marine might employ to purge the battlefield of xenos and heretics, from the simplest combat knife to the most redoubtable of relics. The Master of Ordnance keeps a close watch upon the Chapter's wargear—only his gene-print can grant access to this titanic underground repository of weapons and vehicles."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Aircraft" value="Kor'vattra Nacelle"/>
	<entry name="Tau/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces aircraft as well as increases population limit and generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/AircraftFlavor" value="The Air Caste’s slender limbs and hollow bones are so ill-suited to life on the ground that they are often called ‘The Invisible Caste’ by planet-dwellers. Their nacelles are combined factories, hangars and living spaces—throughout holding technology that reduces the effects of Gladius Prime’s gravity on their delicate physiology."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Construction" value="Brachyuran'm Foundry"/>
	<entry name="Tau/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates ore, research and influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/ConstructionFlavor" value="The Brachyuran might not be suited to combat—after all, they mostly closely resemble crustaceans similar to tiny Terran crabs—but their compact form conceals a fierce technical intelligence, ideally suited to delicate construction. In this foundry, teams of Brachyuran can aid the Earth Caste in building structures, from the macro to the micro level."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Energy" value="Sho'aun'or'es Plant"/>
	<entry name="Tau/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="Tau/EnergyFlavor" value="The Demiurg were the first to lend the T’au their expertise, but the T’au have also drawn upon the abandoned technology of the Imperium, refining it in their way. This strange structure reflects that mixed origin, showing T’au aesthetics imposed on an Imperial reactor cluster."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Food" value="P'greet'an Hydroponics"/>
	<entry name="Tau/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="Tau/FoodFlavor" value="Many races have joined the T’au, but not all have some unique skillset. The Greet are an aquatic race, undistinguished in most fields; all they can contribute to the T’au is their labour and knowledge of aquaculture in these sealed hydroponic farms."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Loyalty" value="Ta'aun Totem"/>
	<entry name="Tau/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Tau/LoyaltyFlavor" value="This is a simple statue to Aun’Va, the Ethereal Supreme, showing him supporting the way, sculpted as a portal through which all the races of the galaxy flow. Embedded in its bone-white surface are a range of listening devices, to track the sentiment of the population and isolate dissident elements."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Headquarters" value="Tau'shiro HQ"/>
	<entry name="Tau/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="Tau/HeadquartersFlavor" value="Named after the Air Caste’s continent-sized space stations, this fortress acts as the central point of the colony-city. It is theoretically the solitary preserve of the Commanders in a military situation, but in practice is the seat of the colony’s Ethereals."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Heroes" value="Shan'ar'tol Stasis"/>
	<entry name="Tau/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates food and influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/HeroesFlavor" value="Commanders like ShadowSun and PureTide are rare individuals, raised up by the Ethereals to be representatives of all that is good and true about the T’au. So few are they that, when not deployed on campaigns, they are placed in stasis until the next time they are needed."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Housing" value="Tio'ur'm Pods"/>
	<entry name="Tau/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Tau/HousingFlavor" value="These sturdy housing units shelter the T’au’s greatest resource—its population of T’au and general workers. It is often the best-defended location next to the Ethereals—because without workers and families to survive and rebuild, where is the worth in fighting?"/>

	<entry name="Tau/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as increases population limit and generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/InfantryFlavor" value="In this smooth-skinned blister-bunker, Fireblades and other T’au veterans train up the members of the fire caste from Shas’saal recruits into full-blown Shas’la Fire Warriors, administering the Trial of Fire at the end of their fourth year."/>

	<entry name="Tau/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/InfluenceFlavor" value="The Water Caste are diplomats-supreme—able to talk round the most intransigent, alien species to the T’au—but on hostile Gladius, their skills are best employed in this lean communications tower proselytising on all channels, attracting the remaining population to the cause."/>

	<entry name="Tau/MonstrousCreaturesDescription" value="Building that produces monstrous creatures as well as generates research and influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/MonstrousCreaturesFlavor" value="Once a Fire Warrior has passed their Trial-By-Fire and proven themself, they are allowed to don the Her'ex'evre or Mantle of Heroes and pilot a battlesuit. Here, the iconic T’au machines are assembled by the Earth Caste, with Brachyuran technicians working on the fine internal mechanisms."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Ore" value="Anthrazod'm Refinery"/>
	<entry name="Tau/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="Tau/OreFlavor" value="A sturdy Xenos species, the Anthrazods normally spend their lives mining asteroids for the greater good. The shortage of manpower—and lack of asteroids—on Gladius means they’re working more closely with the Earth Caste to extract and refine ore."/>
	<entry name="Tau/Research" value="Bentu'sin Lab"/>
	<entry name="Tau/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Tau/ResearchFlavor" value="The squat race that the Imperium knows as the Demiurg are called the ‘wise-gifted ones’ or Bentusi by the T’au, for their mastery of advanced science and automation. They are normally a semi-allied space-bound race, but on Gladius they have been forced to the ground, where they dole out their advanced technology to the T’au grudgingly."/>

	<entry name="Tau/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="Tau/VehiclesFlavor" value="Here the dour Earth caste craft the unique skimmer vehicles available to the T’au military. Over time, they assure you, they will be able to increase their capabilities."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Aircraft" value="Capillary Tower"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces flying monstrous creatures and generates research as well as increases the loyalty and population limit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/AircraftFlavor" value="Tall as a human Hive City, Capillary Towers are the backbone of Tyranid conquest. Here, the resources of the planet are siphoned from Reclamation Pools and fed up through the troposphere to meet the umbilical tongues of orbiting Hive ships. On Gladius, the Towers have no Hive Ships to feed. Instead, Gargoyles and Hive Crones crawl from birthing sacs on the Tower's sides and wait for their newborn wings to stiffen so they can join the war."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Biomass" value="Reclamation Pool"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/BiomassDescription" value="Building that generates biomass."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/BiomassFlavor" value="A Reclamation Pool is one of the core structures of a Tyranid invasion, a wide bubbling cartilaginous pit bubbling with acids and enzymes. Irrespective of the war raging around it, the Hive's swarming rippers bring collected biomass to the Reclamation Pool where it is dissolved. In a normal situation, it would be fed through Capillary Towers up to the waiting Hive Fleet; on Gladius, the biomass is stored or used in the creation of more troops."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Construction" value="Megafauna Sac"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates biomass and increases the population limit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ConstructionFlavor" value="Nothing reflects the inhumanity of a hive more than the Megafauna Sac. To a human eye, its smooth membranous dome is reminiscent of a design for a museum. However, when it tears itself asunder to reveal another giant biostructure, pulsating and screaming in its birth throes—when that building is half-dragged, half-crawls its towering flesh into position—when the Sac gums itself back together and ripper swarms consume its afterbirth—the human mind then sees it as truly alien."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Headquarters" value="Norn Cyst"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The organising organism of a Tyranid's hive, the Norn Cyst is always the first biostructure to be placed. The Malanthrope places the hive in a suitable location and tends its exponential growth as the hive manages and defends any connected biostructures. When the hive's use has passed, the Malanthrope strips the Cyst's living connections and carries to a new source of biomass. The remaining redundant structure sloughs itself back into the nearest reclamation pool. Soon, the hive is completely gone."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Heroes" value="Alpha Ovipository"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates biomass and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HeroesFlavor" value="Whilst the Anthropia emerge solely from the Aedanthropum's long-gestation sacs, the most complex synapse creatures take even more of the Hive Mind's resources and, crucially, focus. Each Tyrant, Tervigon and Prime requires careful design from the Mind, to give it that balance between total control and useful independence. The concentrated sensoria of the Ovipository enable that focus."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Housing" value="Hibernation Marsupia"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HousingFlavor" value="Excess biomass and genetic data are simply stored in the thickened walls of the biostructures or flow twitching between them. But when a creature has been grown, sometimes the Hive Mind deems it more efficient to retain it but shut down its functions, stored in serried ranks of marsupia."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Infantry" value="Brood Nest"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry and beasts as well as generates biomass and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfantryFlavor" value="While a Norn Queen normally produces all the creatures of a Tyranid invasion, in the circumstances that a brood is physically isolated from the Hive Fleet, certain specialised structures are used. Smaller creatures like Termagants are gestated in the pods of this nest, fed and warmed by the unthinking structures."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Influence" value="Synapse Node"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfluenceFlavor" value="The Hive Mind's capabilities aren't spread evenly throughout its structures—somewhere, there needs to be concentrated systems for thought. In the Hive Fleet, these are the Norn Queens. On the ground, these synapses act as temporary back-ups to the network effect from its individual creatures, allowing the Mind to focus on more objectives than simply controlling the swarm."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Loyalty" value="Coherence Node"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/LoyaltyFlavor" value="An Imperial scholar, might make an analogy between a coherence node and something like a radio tower—and, certainly, it's orchid-ear appearance fits—but it doesn't transmit but receives. The node's folded surfaces track the locations of the Hive Mind's creatures for the most efficient deployment of its synapses, to prevent the Hive swarms falling into anarchy and chaos."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Research" value="Genetic Epicure"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ResearchFlavor" value="Though the Malanthropes are responsible for physically collecting genetic data from a planet's population, the Epicure is the structure that processes those samples. Inside the Epicure's fluted mass, delicate structures pare and sort the genetic samples, testing them on a microscopic scale for useful innovations. When something is discovered, it is immediately communicated to the Norn Cyst and hence onto the Hive Mind."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Thropes" value="Aedanthropum"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ThropesDescription" value="Building that produces Thropes and generates research."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ThropesFlavor" value="Not all Tyranid creatures are equal; whilst Termagants and Hormagaunts require little focus and unspecialised resources, the construction and gestation of more complex creatures can take more care. In isolated hives like that of Gladius, the diverse support creatures the Imperium calls Anthropia—Venomthropes, Zoanthropes and Malanthropes—all emerge from a specialised biostructure of gristly columns, podia and caverns."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Vehicles" value="Brood Haunt"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground-based monstrous creatures and generates biomass."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VehiclesFlavor" value="Some of the Hive Mind's creations are produced by separate biostructures because of the care and resources taken in their rendering. Others are simply large. The Brood Haunt houses those brutish giants that are far too big for the Brood Nest. Inside this high-spined haunt, womb-caverns of bone filled with suspensory fluid allow the layering of muscle and bone for these monstrous giants."/>
