	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story0" value="Chapter 1: Analysis—Blessed Inception"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story0BeginningDescription" value="You have fond memories of your days as a menial in the canyons of Mars and as an Tech-Acolyte on Fecundia. Decitor Cambre-Neon 7 was with you then, first as a fellow menial, then a bodyguard, now as your Skitarii Marshal. He has shared your mission, this last century. So when he confirmed that the execution protocols were finally approved and released, you eagerly began initiating the early stages.<br/><br/>That mission meant you had to be absent from your post, as Magos Benedict is quick to remind you. Absent when the Ork invasion began. Absent when the Tyranids breached containment. Absent when the Adeptus Mechanicus forces—including the prized Kastelans—were scattered across the planet. Absent as Gladius Prime—once a proud Hive World—was reduced to a wasteland with barely a billion souls scrabbling in the ruins and with every Xenos and heretic battling for its remaining wealth.<br/><br/>But you cannot explain to Benedict. You must treat your mission as if it came from the High Lords of Terra or the Fabricator General. Indeed, the Astra Militarum or Adeptus Astartes would not even support your studies of the Tyranids, and hence must be treated as hostile—let alone your ultimate plan."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story0Stage0Description" value="But before planning, one must survive. And to survive, Cambre-Neon 7 reminds you, we must build Mars anew, here."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story0Stage1Description" value="You have taken your remaining Skitarii retinue to a derelict hive city, which will be the foundation of your Forge. You chose this location with a reason—at its heart, an ancient Titan frame left here at the time of the planet’s conquest. If resurrected, it would be unstoppable. You order Benedict to oversee its renovation.<br/><br/>Benedict—Magos Gerontocrat Benedict Sacerdos Quo-Vadis, to say their full name—is a worry. You have suspected their loyalty ever since the rebellion on Unnunicia IV. There, in the moment of your triumph over the heretic cultists, they displayed something akin to emotion. You would have rid yourself of them, but their permissions match your own—indeed, you suspect they somehow exceed them.<br/><br/>“Archmagos, request. Production multiplication essential. One, Manufactorum Cybernetica proximity—two, production line efficiency. Approval?”"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story0EndingDescription" value="From Archaeopter height, the sprawling Manufactoria please you—you can almost see the interlinked flow of materials from this height, with your data overlays reflecting the specialisation that drives your economic surge. The Titan may still take a lifetime to renovate, but this is a good start."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story1" value="Chapter 2: Design—Variable Reduction"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story1BeginningDescription" value="As the Archaeopter brings you back, you look down on your new Forge—on the bismulters and the mekanvils, on the lobotomized servitors, on the properly-catechised tools, on the blessed workers lean and loyal in mind and body. And you see that it is good. Cambre-Neon 7 is still by your side and echoes that thought. “We do the Omnissiah’s work, Magos. We have built, now we must survive.”"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story1Stage0Description" value="Survival will be a challenge—this planet is full of problems. You decide to solve those that might burgeon first: that is, eliminate hegemonizing groups before they get a chance to grow and become a threat."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story1Stage1Description" value="In the Genetor’s necrospariums, the Ork corpses are as expected. But the Tyranids… they are already adapting. Indeed, as you watch, a “dead” hormagaunt is immolated in the act of consuming most of a servitor. This is troubling. Your strategy banked on them not having a local Hive Mind, but it seems they have already grown something like one, out in the ash wastes. If your mission was different, this would be a disaster.<br/><br/>Benedict enters. “Tyranid excursion equals failure. Your absence, your failure. Convenient/inconvenient. Improvement required. Investigation mandated. So say All.” Their insinuations filter through the data networks, subtly altering your access—you can feel your information feeds narrowing and your control weakening as your fellow Magi agree with Benedict’s concerns.<br/><br/>Benedict’s lack of loyalty troubles you. Are they a traitor or just ambitious? That burst of hate and joy he displayed on Unnunicia IV was far beyond expected norms. You have never found sufficient data to reach a conclusion but now see a way to getting conclusive evidence—perhaps this increase in correlative input will lead to an over-reach by Benedict aiding your extrapolation of sensitive and guarded data?<br/><br/>So you pledge to set up an independent investigation of the outbreak, open protocols and feeds for all to see, and to accept the results. Benedict nods and leaves silently, accepting the proposal. The information networks loosen again as your pledge is disseminated.<br/><br/>Gaps in logic paths become evident to you quickly, leading to more detailed probing of the historic protocols. Why was the study of Tyranids sanctioned on a Hive world, when the risks of such a venture were so clear even from a base calculation? How did the containment fail? Most pertinently, several ancient Kastelans and their Datasmiths did survive the breach but reject your commands.<br/><br/>You will start your investigation there."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story1EndingDescription" value="You have enough inputs—enough rogue Tech-Priests. Now to the interrogation… Benedict is buzzing with static. If he’s capable of pleasure, this is where he takes it. You allow him to proceed."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story2" value="Chapter 3: Testing—Uncertain Inputs"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story2BeginningDescription" value="The rogue Tech-priests were silent, no matter what technique Benedict employed (myriad methods and often… disconcerting). But vivisecting their cogitator units reveals their orders came ultimately from Mars itself and are contrary to your briefing. The Tyranids weren’t established here to research weaknesses as on Fecundia but as a failsafe defence—a weapon of last resort.<br/><br/>How could anyone have cogitated positivity for the idea of utilizing the foul Xenos in this way? The notion of containing these creatures much less controlling them was unthinkable. Exploiting them against the planet itself? Or anyone seeking to conquer it? A foolhardy, destructive failsafe, if true. What could possibly be here that Earth could want to destroy so badly, to risk a new Hive Fleet on an Imperial Hive World? And how was it concealed from you? Have you been betrayed by Mars?<br/><br/>(Was Benedict aware?)"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story2Stage0Description" value="It seems like you must investigate this planet more closely. For that, you need better machine spirit permissions. Your irritation bleeds into your environment, setting nearby servitors jittering, dead eyes twitching. You order your forces to bring you anything out of the ordinary, whilst you work to unlock better template permissions in the archives."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story2Stage1Description" value="As you enter the forge archives, Benedict is departing. How does he have these permissions? You barely have them! He nods and speaks as you pass. “Hive derelict—not empty. Titan databank active. Legio Venator. Discovery, secrets… Xenos. Ancient Xenos. Parallel investigation. Return shortly. Omnissiah’s benediction.”<br/><br/>You are glad to see him go but are worried what he might have discovered in the Titan’s memory. What would that ancient machine have seen here, before it was abandoned?"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story2EndingDescription" value="Benedict returns. He hasn’t paused to clean himself from his battles, heading straight to you, augmentations still steaming with off-coloured entrails. “T’au ambush. Scarred Ethereal leader. Captured… died silent. No data. No heresy…” (Is he… smiling?) “Parallel investigation failure. My failure. Apologies.” And he is gone, his Skitarii close behind.<br/><br/>Nothing? He found nothing?! You do not believe him. More, you do not trust him, or his smile. You realise now that you will never trust him. You must remove him."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story3" value="Chapter 4: Transition—Heretical Deviations"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story3BeginningDescription" value=""/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story3Stage0Description" value="To remove a fellow Magos will not be easy. He has his own followers, his own power base. You need support—more than the simple troops of the Doctrina. As tactically sound as they are, you need more Tech-Priests like you… and to inspire them."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story3Stage1Description" value="You surreptitiously send your new aides to the locations Benedict visited but find nothing—indeed, their unsubtle interrogations of the local survivors only manage to bring the attention of a sizable Dark Mechanicus force upon you. Was Benedict in league with them?<br/><br/>They are a ragtag assembly, but you learn quickly that they are not to be underestimated. A comm arrives and distracted by thoughts of Benedict’s heresy, you automatically begin decrypting it. Another mistake. A scream of machine code blasts through your ministrations and cripples your forces. They have a Warpsmith, apparently, a veteran Techmarine of the Long War…<br/><br/>You systems are crippled, glitching with the Warpsmith’s overlaid message. “Machine god (2). betrayerbetrayerbetrayer. Welcome --> Fallen.” You work to purge it. As it is written in the Quaestos Mechanicor, “From the mouths of heretics emit naught but foul vapours. Cut out the tongue and be clean.”<br/><br/>You order the Warpsmith’s tongue cut out and your forces struggle to the assault."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story3EndingDescription" value="The Warpsmith lies eviscerated amidst the remains of his daemonic engines, his crushed vox still whispering “…betrayer…” You order all the heretical remains immolated and the Skitarii responsible wiped and purged from the maniples, for fear of contamination.<br/><br/>On your return, Decitor Cambre-Neon 7 prostrates himself before you. He found Magos Benedict leaving the city with many Skitarii and Magi. He was unable to engage, because of the Magos’ superiority in the Forge hierarchy.<br/><br/>“Magos, he has betrayed you, whatever his reason. And he has taken himself to those who cannot know our mission—the Astra Militarum and the Adeptus Astartes. We must subjugate them all to prevent the heresy spreading.” You cannot disagree, but this is a step beyond."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story4" value="Chapter 5: Evaluation—Questoris Deployment"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story4BeginningDescription" value="“…Archmagos heretek. Fecundia, Mars, Gladius, beyond. Evidence Attached. Extreme DEVIATION…” The message loops, over and over. Benedict claims that you plan impossible wickedness and that they are a Procurator, sent to investigate YOU. That you are connected with the Tyranid facility’s breach.<br/><br/>Lies! All lies! You are loyal to the Omnissiah! It would be madness to release Tyranids anywhere. For safety’s sake, you block the transmissions within the Mechanicus domain. But you are glad he sent them."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story4Stage0Description" value="That’s because Cambre-Neon 7 has traced the route of the signal, to a Chapter Fortress. You must ascertain if Benedict is still there or merely routing the signal through it."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story4Stage1Description" value="The Infiltrators have located Benedict. Two key facts emerge. First, that he is preparing to flee to orbit with a key artefact taken from the Astra Militarum—an ancient device that has some level of control over the warp storms—normally fascinating in itself, and something you could take in triumph back to Mars, if that were your objective. But he can seal you in, should he get to orbit.<br/><br/>Second, that you simply do not have the siege weaponry to assault the Fortress. Yet the noble scions of the Questoris Mechanicus await your orders—you are confident that a single Imperial Knight would crack that fortress wide open."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story4EndingDescription" value="The Marine fortress is a ruin. A pity that the Emperor’s creations were wasted so, though they were not true servants of the Omnissiah. And, more critically, Benedict escaped, although he left his artefact in the ruins of the Apothecarion.<br/><br/>But you do now have his data files on the planet. Irrelevant nonsense, about active Exodite technology embedded in the planet, like the artefact—something you will pay attention to when the world is yours. But here is what you were looking for—the Adeptus Astartes suspected that a shard of the C’tan Deceiver was hidden in the Astra Militarum ranks. This is your target, at last! This was what the Omnissiah sent you to find, and seize."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story5" value="Chapter 6: Implementation—And/Or Simulation"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story5BeginningDescription" value=""/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story5Stage0Description" value="Such was the success of the Knight assault that you order renovation of the Titan frame to be stepped up, ostensibly to undo Benedict’s heretical sabotage—but you fear this is too late to aid in your true mission, the capture of this malevolent C’tan! Cambre-Neon 7 indicates that the Necrons have technology that could be used for this end… this is heresy. But the Omnissiah so commands."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story5Stage1Description" value="The Deceiver fought well. Later, long after the battle is done. You invite Decitor Cambre-Neon 7 to the ruins of the Space Marine city where you can be alone—where you can gloat. You hear him enter the fallen Apothecarion and pride overwhelms your restraint protocols. You declare that you have delivered the Deceiver shard to the Omnissiah!<br/><br/>“Query!>? Omnissiah?! HERETEK.”, a flat voice states. It is not the Decitor—it is Benedict, somehow. You try to shut him out, to signal for aid, but your commands go unanswered—his permissions exceed yours now. You feel, distantly, he has been able to take over your city without alerting you—without a shot being fired.<br/><br/>As your Skitarii (now Benedict’s) enter, you feel him taking ultimate control, even of you, somehow—your mechanical parts are shutting down, your ancient human organs cannot sustain you, the darkness closes about you…<br/><br/>…and in the dark, you feel the Omnissiah enter, empowered. Glory, glory, glory.<br/><br/>Trapped in your dying flesh, in your mind’s eye, you see the ruined Apothecarion filled with static hallelujahs. You feel joy as his body (Living metal? Chitin? Iridescent ichor? Blackstone crackling in its wake?) sways above you all. You do not know if this is in your dying mind or reality anymore—but you’d swear that the others’ screams are real. Very real.<br/><br/>Later, you think this is later. You are bowing to your master, the saviour of mankind, your Omnissiah. You are rejuvenated, in control again. Everything is so clear, you understand it all.<br/><br/>(Are you deceived?) Now to return to the Titan frame, your greatest gift to him, and rule this world at his command."/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicus/Story5EndingDescription" value="Errors were made. Benedict was so close to betraying you, betraying the Imperium, betraying the Omnissiah. But the Omnissiah forgives all. (This is real?)<br/><br/>Empowered by the consumption of the Deceiver shard, you and the Omnissiah waken the Titan’s machine spirits together. (Are you dreaming?) It steps forward, shaking the hive city from its shoulders. Your conquest of Gladius Prime begins here…"/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0" value="Chapter 1: Life in the Guard"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0BeginningDescription" value="Gladius Prime had seemed an excellent placement for a senior Imperial administrator. With its rich resources and strategic location, it was both easy and prestigious to rule. For the local people, life had been by the book—until the day the planet's space stations fell flaming from the sky and the Orks descended, followed by even worse Xenos horrors. The resident Space Marine chapter stood fast but could barely hold out.<br/><br/>As the Commander of the reinforcing Astra Militarum forces, you landed on the planet months ago—but the unexpected reappearance of the planet's warp storms has trapped you on the surface. You've regrouped the surviving civilians and Astra Militarum troops into one city, but there are still soldiers scattered beyond the walls. We must gather them, rebuild our cities, and reclaim this planet. For the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage0Description" value="Our first stage is to get the Imperium's war factories back online. In an Imperial Manufactorum, colonists can live and die without ever seeing the outside world, endlessly building war machines for the glory of mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage1Description" value="We must find our scattered allies and foes. The Imperial Sentinel scout walker may be fragile, but its speed will allow us to explore the planet more quickly. Build one as soon as possible."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage2Description" value="From the safety of his sentinel, the pilot reports that surviving civilians are being hunted by the degenerate Kroot—a polymorphic Xenos species gone feral."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0EndingDescription" value="We've established the city and secured our borders. Yet our troops are severely understrength—but that's a problem for a later time."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story1BeginningDescription" value="Though we've rebuilt our city and cleared its perimeter, our missing soldiers outside the city are still being hunted down by the foul Xenos. Through night and day, the guardsmen's desperate pleas for help dominate our Comm-links. We must gather them, rebuild our cities, and reclaim this planet. For the Emperor!"/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story2BeginningDescription" value="Among the surviving guardsmen of the expedition, we've made a lucky find—an Imperial Tech-priest of Mars. He has an idea as to what might be causing the warp storms, but our current facilities aren't sufficient for his research, nor is the location of our city propitious for the rites of the Machine God. He insists we expand our civilisation beyond these walls, then build Cogitator Stations in two cities to aid his research. With distance, he theorises that he can measure disturbances in the warp between the twin cities, and use the computing machines to locate the storm's source. With his help we can surely clear the swirling clouds of the warp and call the Imperium for aid. This plan is our best—our only—hope."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3BeginningDescription" value="Ensconced in the subterranean workshops of the Cogitator Station, the Tech-priest has rapidly built a small army of Servitors and Skitarii, apparently to study the planet. The Astra Militarum guarding the city have been reporting strange experiments and are uneasy in his presence—but then the cult of the Machine God has always been somewhat otherworldly. Upon emerging from his workshops, he reports that the key to the warp storms seems to be the unusual artefacts that are sometimes uncovered on the surface of the planet. He insists we bring any we find to him—but many are in the hands of the Xenos. We will have to search, beg, barter or steal it from them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3Stage0Description" value="Each artefact is unique and highly sought-after. One of them may be the key to calming the Warp Storms—if it is, we must find it."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4BeginningDescription" value="Meeting the Tech-priest has become… difficult. The soldiers around his chamber seem less to be guarding him than guarding the city against him. You meet in something like No Man's Land inside the Cogitator Station, to transfer the artefact, surrounded by armed troops and his newly-repaired Kastelan robots. The Tech-priest's cybernetic eyes glitter red as you silently hand over the strange equipment. As he turns to go, you catch his sleeve and the soldiers all freeze. “How soon can we expect results?” you ask. His vocoder hisses static and spits “soon”, before he stalks away. You leave, troubled. Soon enough you experience the results."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4Stage0Description" value="Alarms ring throughout the city. Of all things to face, Enslavers! Warpborn horrors man has only heard of in folk tales are assaulting the city. And the Tech-priest has vanished. Survive the attack—we will deal with him soon enough."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4EndingDescription" value="The Enslavers are vanquished, beaten back to the warp, at great cost. In the Tech-priest's abandoned chambers you find horrors beyond human ken—and an artefact that must have lured them. What was he doing? We must find him."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story5BeginningDescription" value="The Tech-priest has betrayed you—why, you don't know. Perhaps he was always loyal to Mars, perhaps the whispers of heresy penetrated his mind. Whatever the reason, he has made his escape while you were busy building palaces and battling foes. Your scouts have located his hiding place—he has installed an artefact on an offworld gunship, apparently hoping to punch through the warp storm with it. You must stop him before he does. Beware though—his Kastelan war machines are amongst the best ancient Martian technology can produce. This will be a hard fight."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Story0BeginningDescription" value="In your ten thousand years of war, you do not remember a worse sojourn in the Warp. Following Abaddon’s 13th Black Crusade in the days after the fall of Cadia, your cruiser jumped into the Warp—and became stuck there, like a wasp in amber.<br/><br/>Time became unreliable. Your crew and the ship itself became infested with the stuff of the Warp, possessed or mutated, until only a handful of your troops remained intact. When the cruiser finally burst from the warp above the Imperial world of Gladius Prime, it was a demonship and your surviving troops fled to the planet below.<br/><br/>After so many millennia though, you know that there is purpose to this. You have been tested and survived. You know that the Dark Gods had reason to send your warband to Gladius Prime and that you must discover it, or face their wrath."/>

Now he—it—is chained in your compound, a twisted wreck that barely survives the mutations tearing it apart and reforming from moment to moment.<br/><br/>Your companion’s mind is gone. From its many mouths, however, he gibbers prophecy. “…the thousandth sword, the circuit completed, the gods in accord, infinity infested…” Your cultists interpret its words to warn of an Imperial attack—but, in its wake, revelation."/>

One god on side, my Lord, as far as the Changer can be trusted.” He peers closely at the blinking wall-eyes. “Our next prospect is more. Avuncular. And more obvious in his desires.

With unholy ritual, infernal contracts and the lives of many slaves, he has produced serried ranks of half-daemon, half-machine monstrosities to crush the Greenskins into bloody paste for the Lord of Skulls’ pleasure. You order the assault."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Story3EndingDescription" value="Your retinue stands on an escarpment, overlooking the Ork camp. The Daemon Engines are still happily stalking the few Greenskins who aren’t dead or disabled. Everywhere else is blood, pooling in the fighting pits and drops.<br/><br/>The Ork chief is still trying to crawl towards you, even with his limbs removed. They really are rather resilient. You sigh, reach down and hack his head off. It carries on trying to bite your ankles, until Enioch kicks it into the pool of blood. As the Ork head sinks, yelling incoherent threats, a daemonic mouth forms out of gore, swallows it and bellows “BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD” before collapsing. Khorne, it appears, approves."/>

No, you are a Chaos Lord, and you have no choice but to go on—to step backwards, is to demand spawnhood like the Master of Executions. That said, Enioch accompanies you in.<br/><br/>You step in the room. The hall is long and quiet. The eyes are quivering but shut. The floor is clear of blood and pus. Even your horrid daemonkin seem intact, purring. It all is *too* calm.<br/><br/>Then you see why. A daemon sits on your throne. Your heart catches. Beauty personified. Alabaster skin, iridescent chitin, eyes faceted like jewels. You struggle for control at its scent, lick dry lips at the erotic curve of its impossible claws. As you struggle with yourself, the walleyes peel open and distorted tongues, limbs and organs emerge, straining for your touch."/>

Every form of depravity, every torture, every transgression happens in the city streets. Your dreams are troubled, delightful. In the morning, you find a gift at your door. And the Warpsmith waiting, untouched by the lust and horror, with coordinates of a Necron tomb."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Story4EndingDescription" value="You’re not sure whether you taught the Necrons to love—but you certainly taught them suffering. Trapping their soulless bodies from escape, experimenting with tortures and horrors, watching the Warpsmith cutting their fleshmetal open to hyperstimulate their pleasure centres… before this day you wouldn’t have said you could make a Necron suffer like this, couldn’t drive a Necron mad with lust.<br/><br/>You feel a heavy crustacean-like claw rest on your shoulder and a rush of lust.

Enioch’s wheedling and the Gods’ blessings have secured you the service of an ancient Daemon Prince.

The Warpsmith’s arcane machinery attunes itself to the planet’s pylons and circuits, whilst Enioch orders cultists to each point of the star.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Story5EndingDescription" value="Everything happens at once. Enioch’s wry face collapses into dust even as he invokes the gods. The warp swallows the Daemon Prince, purple flames immolate the praying cultists, and the Warpsmith is pulled into his arcane machinery, gibbering 1s and 0s. Only you survive, becalmed in the storm.<br/><br/>Failure—and eternal torment—is a moment away.<br/><br/>But, after ten thousand years of striving and horror, you feel the gods’ touch upon you. Dark wings sprout from your back, your limbs grow monstrous. You are a newborn Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided, howling your birth to a dying world.<br/><br/>Your freedom lasts but a second. The ritual drags you into the planet’s core, consuming the ancient spirits hiding there. You are the planet now, a true daemon world. Your unholy presence pulls it and its billion surviving souls into the Warp. There, you will torment them eternally."/>

And certain treasures, like yourself.”<br/><br/>He pauses to inhale crimson vapour from a small skull, carved with dark cherubim. “After all, the place was pandemonium.

I said, 'A certain Lord of Excess has taken an unwelcome interest in my well-being and his minions have been watching for my presence in the Real.

I found some new aliens, ones I’ve not seen. Little blue things, but well-equipped and with such sweet screams. I’m sending them your way, to soften you up.

These Slaaneshi, so fickle in their delights!<br/><br/>So to the Aeldari camp, beside a dormant gate of ornate wraithbone. Where you and I became acquainted for the first time, hmm. You, in your full Seer garb, with your perfect smile. Behind you, aspect warriors, an exarch poised, and an ancient Farseer casting runes.

You and the seer spread some sweet-smelling gunk on the two of them, and began the carving of the runes.<br/><br/>'Oh, my boy. I may affect a certain effete dissolution, but I have survived Commorragh for centuries. I know your idiot role is an act. I know you hate me and want to replace me. And I know that you told the Perfervid where to find me. Now, you either go in there or you die out here. Slowly.'<br/><br/>Do you remember his face? As his mask fell, horror and anger raged across his face. He moved towards me and the Incubi about us raised their klaives. He stopped.<br/><br/>'I- well-played, Archon. Father… Your rivals would have given me your place. I hope Slaanesh takes all time to consume your soul.' He strode calmly into the chamber, the Exarch following, carrying the Suin Daellae. The doors shut behind them. I was so proud of him—in that moment he was a true Drukhari. But my fellow Archons plotting so openly? That was troubling.<br/><br/>Then an age of your incessant chanting and, ahhh. That terrible cry. Slowly the doors opened and out strode the avatar, Kaela Mensha Khaine. The Incubi knelt to it, worshipful. You did not see but, as it passed me, it turned its head. I could see no recognition in its metal eyes, only molten hatred.”"/>

His eyes bulge, then quickly settle, resigned. “I- ah. A subtle poison. Intense, bypassed my wards. When I cut you?”<br/><br/>I stand from the chair, shedding the loose chains, Warlock garb and affected terror. “In my false tears, Duke Roche. A paralytic from a female Catachan Devil barb.” I bow, deeply.<br/><br/>His face is seizing now, as Arkanic advances on him. “Loxlove! Superb disguise. Arkanic’s support I presume.” He is struggling to get his final words out. “Wh-who-?”<br/><br/>“Why, everyone, dear. Too loud was your boasting against our Dark Muse, too great your success for your fellow Archons of the Kabal. And bringing a forbidden seer to Commorragh,” I bow, deeply, “endangering us all… that was the justification for your fall, of course. A lifetime as a Grotesque awaits…”<br/><br/>I allow Arkanic and his wracks to take Roche so that he might be fleshcrafted into a humbler form. Then I seat myself into the warmth of his living chair and sample his crimson vapours. A fine vintage indeed… It is good to be back in Commorragh."/>

Whatever, I long to wield it.”<br/><br/>It is hard to disentangle our history from myth. We believe that the Old Ones created us to defeat the soulless Necrons and Yngir—the C’tan. We also believe that the gods Isha and Kurnous bore us into this world and loved us. In our history, we know that our creation triggered the Enslaver plague and the death of the Old Ones. In our myths, we know that Khaine tried to destroy us because we threatened the gods.<br/><br/>Perhaps these events were the same events. Perhaps it was here that Vaul stood against Khaine, having bound this Necron tomb world in defeat. Perhaps it was here he himself was ‘bound to his anvil’.

Who was the guard, who the prisoner?<br/><br/>Whilst we investigated, the Necrons sensed our presence at their silent tomb and swiftly raised an army against us. The autarch led our forces, whilst I manipulated the ancient devices to our aid."/>

Kaela Mensha Khaine stood where I knelt, a hand of molten blood and metal grasping my double by its neck. It writhed, fought, melted in the Avatar’s grasp and a long twisted figure of golden energy was there, a wicked smile gracing a mocking Aeldari face, as it struggled with the bloody-handed god.<br/><br/>The war wasn’t lost because of the sword. It was lost because the gods fought amongst themselves. And standing before us was the Jackal God, Cegorach’s dark double, he who sows dissent. The Yngir or C’tan called Mephet'ran. The Deceiver. It fled then, a battle of immortal gods laying waste to the chambers, and the Avatar pursued it."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Story4EndingDescription" value="Anaris’ Avatar of Khaine slaughtered the weakened C’tan and its forces alongside me, its Suin Daellae dripping gore constantly. It talked whilst it fought, in a way that no Avatar had before—in its howl of bloodlust it revealed secrets, history, things it knew I could never tell my people. From that moment, I have spoken to no-one for fear of revealing the horrors in a weakened moment. Those tales must die with me."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/Story5BeginningDescription" value="Despite the newfound wisdom, I was still full of questions. Was it here, then that the War in Heaven was lost? When Vaul and Khaine fought and the pantheon took sides, was the Deceiver whispering in the gods’ ears? Was this planet meant to be a model for the Necrons’ ultimate defeat? I knew that then I would have to descend into the planet and become one with it, to learn truly. To give answers back."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Story5Stage0Description" value="Before that time, the spirit had to test us. To see if we Aeldari were still worthy of waking it. It sent foes against us, ritually. To re-enact the battle of Eldanesh and Ulthanesh, Vaul and Khaine, Khaine and Slaanesh. To judge me worthy. The Umbra came too and I had a sudden moment of realisation that they have the same psychic scent about them as Khaine and the World Spirit did—of the ancient wonders that predated our race. Who they once were—an Old One? A C’tan? These secrets await, below."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Story5EndingDescription" value="I write this before I descend into Anaris’ core. Suffice to say, we were victorious and the planet is in our grasp. We are exterminating the other races and departing ourselves. Only the seers and wraiths will stay, to witness this. The full activation of these great infinity circuits, to see what this planet is capable of when fully awake! I hunger to know what it is—what has been trapped inside since the War in Heaven. Is it Vaul? Is it the first among the Aeldari? Is it something else? Already I feel the crystal change coming upon me."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/Story0BeginningDescription" value="As the proud leader of a Necrontyr dynasty, you'd never known defeat. Never, until your people met the Old Ones, and dared to attack their star-spanning empire. Your dynasty had been on the frontline when the war with the Old Ones started, and you were some of the first to face their wrath. Your Fringeworlds were scoured and your Coreworlds besieged for generations. When the C'tan called the Messenger—and now the Deceiver—promised your people immortality through biotransference into undying machine bodies, you snatched at it greedily. Later, you betrayed him and his kind, shattering them into C'tan shards now used as weapons.<br/><br/>To no avail, sadly. Though your new soulless bodies were nigh-indestructible, even as their empire collapsed the Old Ones encircled your crownworld and used their uncanny powers to trap you within it, driving their warp technology into its surface, binding you to the depths. You retreated to the underground stasis tombs that Szarekh, the Silent King, had ordered constructed, and waited for the final assault—which never came. Eventually, you slept, awaiting the Silent King's call.<br/><br/>Now, sixty million years have passed and you've awoken into… chaos. Signs of battle between the Old Ones' humanoid creations litter the surface, as do the ancient enemy's traps. These devastated your people upon awakening, leaving a few surviving tombs widely scattered. Through the warp storm, you can hear nothing from your overlord Szarekh.<br/><br/>Where are the Old Ones? Who won the war? Is this another trap? Where are your C'tan gods? We must investigate—cautiously."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/Story1BeginningDescription" value="One of the tombs holds a Triarch Praetorian called Eystan—a Necron judge. However, he is not of our dynasty, but instead a traveller who became trapped here, long after our slumber began. He tells us that after we destroyed our C'tan gods at the orders of the Silent King, we were victorious in the War in Heaven, crushing the Old Ones. Afterwards we slept, weakened by battle. <br/><br/>In those dying days, Eystan's group had been dispatched into the webway to lead an invasion of Old One homeworlds—but he lost his way in the maze and became stranded on our world when the Webway collapsed. He forced his way into the tomb's entrance, but with no way to enter it proper, has spent sixty million years alone, listening to the waking galaxy. This obfuscating warp storm is a new phenomenon—he believes intended to trap us here."/>

After all, they were fundamental parts of the universe who had achieved sentience—they couldn’t be truly annihilated, only atomised and trapped, lest they re-coalesce. And some C’tan left a curse at the moment of their death, like Llandu'gors’ Flayer disease that drives so many of our warriors to madness.<br/><br/>The Destroyer Cults—which have sprung up on the peripheries of our cities too—are another reflection of the C’tan’s curse. These nihilists are drawn from the best of us—Immortals, Lychguard and Lords—and in their madness, seek only the death of all life.<br/><br/>But whilst we can communicate with our local cults, this maddened army is incommunicate and kills isolated Necrons alongside the living.

The machine that built it is surely here too. If we can find it, she's sure that she can reverse-engineer its technology, and perhaps dissipate the Warp Storm.<br/><br/>That might be harder than it sounds. For, in the intervening millennia, Aeldari, Man, Ork, Jokaero and stranger creatures have left their creations on your Crownworld's surface, and cannibalised the Old One's technology. Gather their artefacts for the Cryptek to study, and we may be able to find the mechanism by which to control the Old One machinery."/>

Her Scarabs enter en masse with her, prompting your Lychguard to gather about you defensively. Instead of conflict, though, the Scarabs bring something else.<br/><br/>Ptanotek explains her scarabs were exploring a long-destroyed Old One habitat, when they happened on some unusual remains. Before she could personally investigate, her scarabs were driven off by the Psychneuein which had infested the ruin.<br/><br/>But they did manage to recover one thing—she presents you with a Rod of Covenant, a traditional Praetorian weapon.

	<entry name="Necrons/Story5BeginningDescription" value="Eystan communicates with you—or, rather, the thing that pretended to be Eystan does. It is a transcendent shard of Mephet'ran, the Messenger, the Deceiver, the same C'tan who doomed your people to these metal bodies with its mellifluous lies. Around it stands a legion of your fellow Necrons, blank-eyed like the Destroyers you defeated before.<br/><br/>In Eystan's tortured voice, Mephet'ran gloats that you have handed it the keys to the Old One's technology, and invites you to submit to your ancient masters. You cut off the communication in despair.<br/><br/>Your Cryptek has her own secrets, however. From a hidden stasis tomb, a Spyder raises a cherished gift from the Silent King, saved from the days of rebellion—an Aeonic device explicitly made to kill a C'tan. If we can recover the control device and use the Old One and Silent King's technology side by side, we can crush this hubristic C'tan.<br/><br/>And once we've shown the other races of this planet that we can crush even a Star God, surely they will fall in line too."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5Stage0Description" value="Shortly, Doom Scythe scouts report that the arrogant C'tan has left the control device with an army of his soulless Necrons. A lightning raid with your full force should be sufficient to drive them off and reclaim it."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/Story5Stage2Description" value="The C'tan too late realises its error and, burning with the Old Ones' energies, orders its soulless armies to attack. If you can defeat it, you will cow the slave races by making them witness a god's destruction."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5EndingDescription" value="The Cryptek deploys her Aeonic weapon, and the thing that killed Eystan one moment screams incoherently and the next whimpers, its incomprehensible intelligence splintered a hundred-fold into Tesseract Vaults under your command.<br/><br/>Knowing now that Eystan was The Messenger, you know that everything he told you was almost certainly a lie—his tales of the war in heaven, the fall of the Old Ones and so on. After all, to think that the Necrons could have defeated both the Old Ones and the C’tan is beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>So, beyond the warp storm, the Old Ones doubtless still rule—but here, you shall stay safe inside this defensive tempest they have so kindly created. This shall remain a true planet of the Necrons, with you ruling over these mortal slaves until such day as you are strong enough to challenge the galaxy once again."/>

They saw the works of the Emperor, the suppression of heresy and the deep riches of the planet dedicated to humanity’s glory, and they saw it was good. First amongst us was Canoness Vandire, last of a long-penitent family. As with all Sororitas, she was orphaned and raised in the Schola Progenium and excelled in trials of the Convent Prioris. She knew her role, to ensure the spiritual purity of humanity and if she suffered the sin of pride at how well she did that, she expiated fully for it every day. Vandire, and we her sisters, walked among the people of Gladius. We did not suffer the heretic to live, but this world was unusually peaceful and spiritual, raising shrines and prayers to the God-Emperor daily."/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story0Stage0Description" value="Yet a mere year after our arrival, this shining example of humanity was crushed by cursed xenos.

The Adeptus Mechanicus’ identification of their Omnissiah with the God-Emperor has been called a convenient fiction—here, it was one that they dispensed with in extremis.

	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story1Stage2Description" value="Over the Mechanicus’ remains, our sisters cast holy water and devotions. Yet the final test was to come—the Adeptus Astartes.

We prayed for guidance."/>

From the skies above, an ancient space hulk emerged, streaming with corrupted Warp energies, and from it descended heretics, scattering across the planet’s surface.

But you may never leave. And with a gory finger he pointed to the roiling sky, where the demon ship hung amidst the endless warp storm and laughed and laughed and laughed. Celestine saying, Think not I come to bring peace, ended him. And his forces fled and were lost in the wilds.

We did not question our Saint’s faith—we could not—but the battles she chose grew more deadly, drawing her closer to a death she seemed to hunger for. The heretic’s last words were whispered then—that we were beyond the Emperor’s Light, that this world was truly abandoned.

Numberless they raised themselves up, as of old, and in their hands—an answer?"/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story4Stage0Description" value="Preacher Melisal voxed in then.

With reverence, his flayed hide was brought down from the steeples of Shrine Primus and laid aside, a relic one day of this war. For this is good and acceptable in the Emperor’s sight. Then came a terrified missionary to Celestine, a rare survivor, and fell down before her, and said to her, Saint, the creatures did search for artefacts beneath our shrines. And the same survivor went out and showed her where they had dug. And Celestine knew the mark of the Necron and said, we are hunting a Cryptek, a collector of wisdom. I know not what it has, merely that the Emperor commands we take it. Canoness, you shall claim it personally."/>

And Canoness Vandire trod on the cooling necrodermis, piled against the tomb walls, and found the Cryptek where it had crawled in its agonies. And with arco-flagellants and Hospitaller tools and the Trial of Castigation she drew its secrets from it—of the pylons and of the C'tan they were intended to contain. When Vandire understood, she said unto Celestine, this planet is a trap for another and a good work it is. And Celestine knew the pylons of Cadia, how they had sapped her spirit and she saw these ones differed, and she saw it was good. In that same hour, Celestine said, there is still a way. Fleeing Cadia, the webway was our saviour. And I feel it here too."/>

It stood at the end of an enclosed valley, once a pleasure garden for the Hive World’s rich. The valley ended in an ancient glacier which had been dug away to reveal the Webway Portal beneath. Its gates were sealed and its wraithbone was black as ash. About it, between the vale’s slopes, swelled a mighty Aeldari force."/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story5Stage0Description" value="And Celestine said, we might talk to them, they aided me on Cadia. But Vandire would not brook treating with the xenos and Celestine demurred saying, I have no guidance here. But I must reach it. I mourn their death."/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story5Stage1Description" value="And Celestine stood by the gate, amidst the fine dead of the Aeldari; and we worked to open the gate, but it would not move. And the mechanisms were beyond our comprehension. So Vandire cursed the foul xenos. Wherefore, an Aeldari Ranger was brought to her, a survivor of the battle, longsighted Aerl. And once she had cursed and damned the Saint, she calmed and explained. That the gate had been built by the damned Aeldari others call Drukhari. That they had been preparing for its destruction, as it could not be opened without hideous suffering. And we saw the charges set at the gate's edge and knew she spoke truth. And Vandire smiled then, a fair look, saying, that is fortunate for suffering comes our way. And Celestine looked at the augurs to see that the Chaos horde had not been idle whilst we searched, that it had augmented and taken much of this world. And that it came for vengeance for its lost Lord. Suffering, it seemed, would be on all sides."/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattle/Story5EndingDescription" value="Behold, the gate stood and Celestine stood by it. And we died all around it and our foes too, in agony and horror. And it crackled and opened to the screaming Empyrean, and she stepped through urging us after. And I followed, I followed the saint, the least of our humble remembrancers. And Vandire bowed and stopped my sisters saying, no, we cannot hold them. We die here. And we looked upon the battle behind her as a mighty Khornate war engine breached the end of the hidden valley, and knew she spoke truth. So we retreated in and knelt and prayed. And Vandire detonated the Aeldari charges and sealed the webway behind us. And now I am alone with Celestine in the Drukhari webway and I entrust these recordings to her. For men and women do not live long in this place."/>

	<entry name="Tyranids/Story1Stage1Description" value="Once the Malanthropes were grown, they were dispatched to recover biomass and fresh genetic data by consuming great tracts of land, killing the local peak predators and sampling their data."/>

That humanity might be crushed between these three Xenos horrors. My remaining flesh ached with despair. Yet an unexpected ally gave us a chance to destroy them once and for all.<br/><br/>Tech-Adept, the planet itself rose up against them.<br/><br/>It seems that Gladius housed some long-forgotten Xenos technology, perhaps the self-same that trapped us here under the warp storms. Great spires of burnished Exodite metal rose from the ground around the Tyranid hives. From my analyses of its remains, I suspect it may pre-date even the Aeldari—as far back as… [data missing]"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story2Stage0Description" value="Where the spires rose, the warp storms intensified, purging the planet's surface of life. The Tyranids were thrown back—for a time."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story2Stage1Description" value="The Imperials forces, who had been prepared to die defending our cities, seized the moment and attacked. I lent some of my Kastelans to the effort, however small the chance of victory was."/>

A second hive arose to fight the first, and a real hope emerged amongst the defenders that the Hive Fleet would spend all its biomass in futile internecine war.<br/><br/>I had no such illusions. I knew that one swarm would prevail and emerge the stronger for the test. That soon the isolated Tyranid strain would call out to space and attract the nearest Hive Fleet—perhaps a fragment of Tiamet—and then all would be consumed."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story3Stage0Description" value="The two Hive Minds met in battle soon after. I don't know if the original survived or the challenger, but it mattered little—the winner adapted first, then consumed its opponent's troops, so it shared the genetic data of both."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story3EndingDescription" value="As I predicted, this conflict, far from being an obstacle, was an accelerant for the Tyranids' planetary conquest. Our astropath reported that the hive had created something like a Brood Mind—a psychic beacon strong enough to pass through even the maelstrom above. The Hive Fleet was coming.<br/><br/>For Gladius Prime's loss to mean something, someone needed to survive and pass this data onto the Adeptus Mechanicus. I planned my escape from the planet."/>

Report concerning Divisio Biologis operations on Gladius Prime.<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>Months passed, Tech-Adept. The planet continued to ramp up the pressure on the Xenos, turning the planet's life against them, even as the Shadow in the Warp fell over Gladius Prime and the Hive Fleet encircled it.<br/><br/>We now felt like bystanders in a battle between giants. It must have become obvious to the Hive Mind that it couldn't simply consume this world like normal—their dreaded spore pods couldn't get through the warp storms and they couldn't breed fast enough on the surface to overcome our defenses. It needed something special to crack the planet wide open.<br/><br/>The few Imperial satellites and the Space Marine Battle Barge reported that the hive fleet was circling the planet, throwing mycetic spores downward, probing the storm. Though nothing made it through, the fleet seemed to identify a relatively stable point in the storm. The Shadow In The Warp pushed on it, widening it."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story4Stage0Description" value="On the surface, the Hive Mind moved its resources, coordinating with the fleet above, aiming somehow to reach through the storm. Its forces were seen near to a dormant Necron tomb city—perhaps the storms were weaker there?"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story4Stage1Description" value="There was a peace for a time, whilst the Hive Mind nested and gathered resources. Peace, only in the context of endless war, of course."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story4Stage2Description" value="Then, like a delicate strange flower but impossibly tall, a Capillary Tower rose from the new hive. We watched it stretch miles and miles high, growing into the atmosphere."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story4EndingDescription" value="From the surface, we could see only see the Capillary Tower. Yet the few Imperial craft in low orbit reported seeing the Hive Ships creeping closer extending strange tendrils trailing down to the tower's tip, burning with witchfire as the warp storm tore at them. It was a short connection only—but in reconnecting, the local Hive Mind fragment had learned how to destroy this world."/>

At its birth, every psyker on the planet howled—the Hive Mind had sent something monstrous to the planet.<br/><br/>The planet's defences knew that this was the end too—it scraped up everything left to it, every horror driven from its lair and forced towards the Tyranid hives. Orks, Psycheneuin, Catachan Devils, degenerate Kroot. And the Hive Mind defended its gestating horror with equal vigour."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story5Stage0Description" value="The battle was endless—it wasn't clear whether we'd survive the planet's defences, let alone the Tyranid assimilation."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story5Stage1Description" value="My attempts to secure an artefact to stabilise the storm and a ship to leave Gladius had been frustrated by the Tyranid arrival and the loss of my Kastelans. Escape from the planet was impossible, I now recognised. In our makeshift fortifications, the Imperial Cult led the prayers to the God-Emperor one last time—and I prayed to the Omnissiah.<br/><br/>Then I organised for my notes to be preserved in the traditional method—buried alongside the Marines' gene-seed in a drill, deep in the planet's crust. And I prepared myself for death.<br/><br/>And out there, in the ruins of our civilisation, the Tyranid creature—the Doom of this planet—crept closer to its destiny, the heart of this strange alien world. Our satellites saw it battling towards the base of a Tower of Vaul—perhaps to access the Exodite mechanisms inside?"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Story5EndingDescription" value="Have you ever felt a planet just… die? We all felt that at the last. Beneath our feet, it trembled. Whatever ancient power had been battling the Tyranids was finally defeated, its psychic energies absorbed by the Tyranid's monstrous creation.<br/><br/>And then it started to come apart. That ancient machine, whatever it was, must have simply been holding the entire planet together—even now the earth shudders constantly beneath our feet, the gravity shifting wildly. If it continues at this rate, the planet will simply disintegrate—denying the Tyranids its resources at least.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this message will survive. I am handing it to my servitor, to send into the planet's crust now—I hope it will survive the collapse of the planet. May the Omnissiah have mercy on our souls."/>
