	<entry name="AngelFlightFlavor" value="And lo did the Seraphim take flight, a weapon unlike any unleashed on our Earth before. Getting one airborne took a massive amount of energy, and the discharge could turn weapons into mountain-shattering laser cannons. The Acrin feared technology like this. Now it exists because of their invasion."/>
	<entry name="AntimatterDilationFlavor" value="Children used to hold up magnifying glasses in the sunlight to burn their names into planks of wood. A Cherubim Titan could use Antimatter Dilation to be the sun and glass all at once, carving the very spirit of an empire into our enemies’ bones. If there were any bones left."/>
	<entry name="ArmorOfFaithFlavor" value="Most of us mustered willpower on the battlefield, but the Prophet channeled something else—faith. With faith, he could do something the techs never came close to figuring out: how to project pure invulnerability. Was it supernatural? A power even beyond the Voice? I never found out."/>
	<entry name="ArtificersPrecisionFlavor" value="The Artificer had an eye for precision. In her craft, in her programming, and in warfare. When she monitored a battle, she’d use every tool at her disposal to amplify all targeting data sent out to the troops. Few other leaders were so… intimate with the killing their soldiers did."/>
	<entry name="AssassinateFlavor" value="First we killed to survive, then we killed those who stood in our way. Then we killed for those watching. To send a message—to use murder as a means of communication. We gave up something… sacred, when we chose to kill this way. We didn’t care. By then, there was too much at stake."/>
	<entry name="EnhancedProbabilityAugment" value="Gunslingers of old needed intuition to land a deadeye shot. The Operative looked to them for inspiration for this particular augment. Intuition could be… simulated. Redesigned with equations. She had such an eye for taking what made us human and recreating it with just numbers."/>
	<entry name="LiquidDeflectionAugment" value="The Operative’s troops couldn’t dodge every shot. She turned her attention to reducing the brunt of the blows. ”Be like water,” a great master once said. With some experimentation, she could make that a… literal improvement."/>
	<entry name="NanomachineAcceleratorAugment" value="The Operative was quite comfortable with the creation of… certain performance enhancements. On machines and biologicals alike, she could boost stamina and speed with the help of nanomachines. Her troops couldn’t move much faster but they could get a hell of a lot farther."/>
	<entry name="ChoralCelerityFlavor" value="Gods, what an awful day it was. We'd sprung on the Voice cultists by surprise, struck their base before they had a chance to mobilize their forces. But a high-pitched wail came out from the Masked Hymnal, and within seconds good men and women were trapped in its power. Whatever it cost them to pull that off… it cost my people more."/>
	<entry name="AuraOfDisciplineFlavor" value="Just the presence of a Commander on the battlefield could keep troops focused. We tried to capture the same effect with armored vehicles but it… never had the same impact. There was something personal about a leader’s presence, something you can’t replicate with machines."/>
	<entry name="BombardmentFlavor" value="Some things never changed with war. One was that if you wanted a reliable artillery strike, you needed a good spotter. We trusted our commanders to call the shots… not just because they could land the kill. They could also make sure our troops got out of the blast zone."/>
	<entry name="CallTheAfflictedFlavor" value="The Voice granted the Whisperer a gift: the power to create life. Not true life though, just a mockery of it. But is a Deformity any different than a mayfly? Maybe we deserved to be laughed at for thinking our lives meant anything."/>
	<entry name="CauterizeWoundsFlavor" value="The first soldiers we augmented with cybernetic tech were still vulnerable to attacks on vital organs. With a little extra programming, our techs could numb their pain sensors, but they still needed to be patched up. If they already couldn’t feel pain, there was no reason to not let them cauterize their own wounds."/>
	<entry name="CherubimAegisFlavor" value="The Cherubim had the power to expand their shielding to other units in the area. The sensation was… pleasant. Oddly pleasant. A great weapon of war wrapping you up in its embrace, offering protection, and sanctuary… while its guns pounded the enemy into mulch."/>
	<entry name="ClearTileFlavor" value="Buildings and soldiers alike needed solid ground to stand on. We trained Engineers to clear terrain for both purposes. It was back-breaking work—the new world we lived in was filled with all kinds of alien substances. It was like its own kind of combat prep. You could fight the earth or the enemy—doing both was too much for anyone."/>
	<entry name="CombatRoutineFlavor" value="The first machines we encountered weren’t always fully ready for combat—but they would be once the shooting started. It was eerie how they’d become better shots once they took a hit. Some kind of triangulation subroutine or something."/>
	<entry name="ConjureBleedFlavor" value="The Voice has more than one way into our world. It taught some beings how to open holes to another reality. The air itself was like skin, and these tendrils came oozing out. Sometimes you wanted to be surrounded by the Voice. Other times, you wished for a new kind of silence."/>
	<entry name="CryOfContritionFlavor" value="Did the Voice… care… about those who spoke to it? Did it need to be convinced? Taught to empathize with living beings? I didn’t think such an entity would find value in saving lives. Maybe it had a bigger vision in mind. Or maybe it did feel some kind of mercy."/>
	<entry name="DanceOfTheErelimFlavor" value="You'd forget the Erelim weren't entirely human—until you saw them dance. Their eyes glazed over, their machine minds calculated the movements of all enemies surrounding them. Then their faces would open, their blades would extend, and they began the slaughter. The beauty and grace of their movements… that was the terrifying part. The AI wasn't just killing for efficiency. Now it was killing to… make art? Express itself? I just knew it wanted you to watch."/>
	<entry name="DataHackFlavor" value="The Emulated Mind knew the back roads and less-used byways of every networking system. She loathed using such paths, but found there was some purpose to them. She’d reach out her mind, walk through the back door, and have a look at what our enemies were researching. She could accept that function."/>
	<entry name="DecoyFlaresFlavor" value="All the smart tech in the world and missiles still did their tracking by looking for the hottest object in the sky. That meant Decoy Flares still had a purpose—even worked decently on sentient attackers too. Everything, no matter how intelligent, gets surprised by a sudden light bursting in the sky."/>
	<entry name="EchoesFromBeyondFlavor" value="The Voice knew things. Impossible things. Was it petty to simply use its premonitions to see our enemies? Or was that how the Voice drew people in? Did it show them knowledge, promise power, then offer more? The Whisperer knew. She didn’t ever say."/>
	<entry name="EntombFlavor" value="The Archai had the power to exploit every one of your vulnerabilities all at once. If it locked you down… you couldn’t move. You could barely breathe. If there wasn’t someone who could pull you out of there, that was it, you were dead. All you could do is watch, eyes locked open, as your enemies lined up the killing blow."/>
	<entry name="EradicateBleedFlavor" value="The Voice still had to play by our laws of physics, even if it managed to bend them a little. That left the Bleed open to decontamination. ZEPHON and our techs seemed to both figure out that you could clean up the Bleed—if you were willing to risk a little close exposure."/>
	<entry name="EvasionProcessorFlavor" value="The Erelim could let her machine side take over—just a little—to walk in between the hail of bullets. She lured enemies close, thinking they could land a blow at close-quarters. But close-quarters is where the Erelim do their best work."/>
	<entry name="EvasiveManeuversFlavor" value="Rookie pilots were sent up with a manual of routine maneuvers for dodging enemy fire. The best pilots threw that manual out the window. Sometimes… literally. The best way to survive in the sky was to be unpredictable, to go where your target doesn’t suspect you will."/>
	<entry name="FoundCityFlavor" value="Long ago, our ancestors built cities over the course of generations. We didn’t have that luxury. Engineers laid the foundation for massive urban spaces with pre-fabricated buildings and drones that could quickly rig up infrastructure. We could always build over them later… if the war ever came to an end."/>
	<entry name="FoundationOfBloodFlavor" value="People were just tools, to the Artificer. You’d hope a good craftswoman would learn to love her tools, but she never developed such attachments. I warned her once that objects could be replaced, but people couldn’t. She disagreed. Violently."/>
	<entry name="FrenzyFlavor" value="It wasn’t surprising that desperation could turn anyone into a killing machine. It was surprising that some fighters seemed to relish it. Outnumbered? Outgunned? That didn’t matter to them. Banding up with these berserkers might keep you alive—but they were just as likely to get you killed."/>
	<entry name="GhostWalkFlavor" value="I always wanted to know… what was it like for the Erelim to walk where no light could reflect? What did the earth look like? Was it… more peaceful there? Or did maintaining true invisibility mean you had to step through the void and just use sensor data to navigate the terrain? I asked one, once. She wouldn’t answer."/>
	<entry name="GravitonJammerFlavor" value="Our weapons researchers learned by accident that gravitons could be altered to create a disorienting effect. The sensation of your inner organs floating was described as “intensely unpleasant.”"/>
	<entry name="GroundedFireFlavor" value="An operator's keen eye wasn't always enough. To land a precise shot from the missile platform, the machine sometimes needed to dig its heels into the earth and brace against the recoil. It made for a more steady shot. It also made operator and drone alike vulnerable to attack."/>
	<entry name="HastFlavor" value="The Valkyria had repositioning capabilities that no other heavy armor could match. That's because their pilots could override the safety protocols through sheer willpower. When those shut down, the Valkyria operators pushed their exosuits to the limit. They broke their bodies and ravaged their minds in pursuit of victory."/>
	<entry name="HijackFlavor" value="After we began deploying mechs, tanks, and other heavy armor, I thought the Chieftess would keep her distance. I was an idiot. The Reavers followed her for a reason. She knew a good pillaging opportunity when she saw one, and knew how surprised we'd be to see her Reavers bearing down on us with our own machines."/>
	<entry name="HiredHandsFlavor" value="The Aristocrat built out entire networks of favors he could call in. It’s something the other warlords and would-be rulers didn’t get. If you could win the loyalty of your people—by trust or with coin—you could cash it in when you most needed it, especially when producing materials or weapons."/>
	<entry name="HolyInfernoFlavor" value="Where did the flames come from? The Seraphim didn’t go skybound with explosive fuel like that. I dug through their schematics time after time to try and get an answer. There wasn’t one. The only clue I had was that the melody it made… always shifted frequency when it unleashed the inferno. Was that it? Did it unleash holy fire with a song?"/>
	<entry name="HymnOfDecayFlavor" value="When I first felt the toxic touch of this tortured hymnal I assumed there was a strategic reason for poisoning the earth like this. But after so many battles… there had to be more to it. Was it spiritual? Or was it an act of childish spite? I imagined doomed aliens lashing back at our world for daring to resist their apocalyptic mission. The thought chilled me to the bone."/>
	<entry name="IcarusSatelliteFlavor" value="The Icarus Satellite network was a weapon developed by an old world company named ICAR Corp that never got online. For too long we thought it was just a myth. Then the Rogue Operative showed up on the scene with the missing link: an authorization key that assumed she was the CEO of ICAR. Only she could call down the Icarus' firepower—even if someone killed her and took it, they'd never crack her layers of encryption on the damn thing."/>
	<entry name="InterferenceProtocolsFlavor" value="Machines do what you tell them to do, not what you want them to do. With the right programming, you could tell your enemy’s machines all kinds of interesting lies. They’d think up was down, friend was foe, and light was dark. Of course, enemy techs worked to counteract that programming, so it wasn’t a silver bullet. But it made it easier to dodge their shots for a short period of time."/>
	<entry name="IronWillFlavor" value="When giving up began to feel more comforting than the struggle, you needed to remind yourself why you fought. Every soldier would whisper a different story to themselves. Some would just utter a name. Those words would fill your blood with fire and make the struggle feel worthwhile again."/>
	<entry name="JumpPackFlavor" value="Antigravity technology vastly outpaced whatever a rocket could do in keeping soldiers airborne. That was fine. Slow airborne units made for easier targets. There was still value in using precision rocket bursts to reposition our elite infantry. War is a game of positioning, after all."/>
	<entry name="MarkTargetFlavor" value="Snipers and wolves have plenty in common. They hunt in packs, and know how to set up their packmate’s kill."/>
	<entry name="MinelayerFlavor" value="Outrider operators knew when the bullets started flying, they weren’t combatants: they were bait. Their job was to lay mines in key positions and lure the enemy in. Then once the trap was sprung, they could burn rubber and get away—and whatever was hunting them became easy pickings for the rest of us."/>
	<entry name="NeverSurrenderFlavor" value="A Commander’s job is to keep troops on the battlefield—to make sure they don’t flee when fear takes over. Too many of us would have gladly surrendered if it meant we could live another day. But the right leader in the right place could make you willing to lay down your life for a better world."/>
	<entry name="OrbitalDeploymentFlavor" value="Launching soldiers into orbit so they could redeploy half a continent away was not an efficient process. But you know what scared the hell out of our enemies? Metal pods crashing into the ground at explosive speeds, followed by an armored creature kicking open the hatch, ready to do nothing but kill."/>
	<entry name="ParticleBarrierFlavor" value="No other shielding behaved the way the Krypt Archai’s Particle Barrier could. Shields normally needed a power source—I lost too many soldiers trying to keep that power online. These barriers… they just… worked. Maybe the particles were the power source? Drawing energy from within and clustering to catch incoming fire? It was… otherworldly."/>
	<entry name="ParticleRepairFlavor" value="The particles pouring out of a Krypt Archai’s… shell could work wonders on mechanical units. It was like something out of a fairy tale. All it took was a stream of glowing lights to bring battered and broken machines back online. Wiring, servos, energy conduits—they could fix it all."/>
	<entry name="PowerSpikeFlavor" value="The techs plastered the Vulkan manuals with all kinds of restrictions. Vulkan pilots knew how and why to break them. If you overcharged the power past its limits, you’d blow out whole pieces of the Vulkan. But in exchange you could fuel that power into all of the Vulkan’s weapons. Risking that extra damage was a gamble but it paid off frequently."/>
	<entry name="QuidProQuoEnergyFlavor" value="The Aristocrat always had his eye on the energy grid, watching how a few… less-than-honorable types could draw off energy for illicit projects. He let them operate—under the condition that when he came calling, they’d open their energy stores back up to him."/>
	<entry name="QuidProQuoFoodFlavor" value="Everyone was always squirreling away food. The Aristocrat was the only one who could get people to part with it. It was like the old fable about a savior who could feed his followers with an infinite supply of bread and fish. If that savior was real, maybe he and the Aristocrat spoke the same language—the language of mutual aid and survival."/>
	<entry name="QuidProQuoMineralsFlavor" value="The world of mineral trading was full of colorful characters. The Aristocrat could work all of them like a showman on the stage. He’d ply them with favors and gifts to sweeten the deal whenever he needed extra resources."/>
	<entry name="QuenchResistanceFlavor" value="The Artificer knew there would be consequences to how she treated people. Other leaders would be blind to the backlash or assume fear was enough to keep people in line. She was not so foolish. She knew from day one that violence was inevitable. And she used it without a moment of hesitation."/>
	<entry name="ReconFlavor" value="Outriders were sent out with long photographic lenses, old radar dug up from wartime bunkers and specialized sonar—all so their analysts could spy on enemies from a distance. They’d sit in the back of the Outrider, furiously piecing together information as the vehicle bucked and jolted on the rough road below."/>
	<entry name="RecycleFlavor" value="Spend enough time digging in the junk and every piece of trash looks like treasure. Don’t know how he did it, but the Romantic knew how to make the most of everything. He tasked factory operators to follow the same logic—weapons, armor, tools—they could all be re-used for a greater purpose."/>
	<entry name="RepairFlavor" value="Executing repairs took time to prepare and meant the technician had to stay close to the machine. If you wanted to make a fast friend, you kept anyone repairing your tech safe. They were doing the same for you, after all. I still can’t believe there were soldiers who’d sacrifice them like pawns."/>
	<entry name="SatelliteScanFlavor" value="I’d wander into the satellite facilities during the rare moments of downtime for some… unauthorized usage. I looked further… toward ruins of the old world. Sometimes I hoped I’d open a scan and find buildings still standing, life still going. I wanted to see a place untouched by war, someplace free from death."/>
	<entry name="SkyddaFlavor" value="Here’s a contradiction: The Valkyria operators were fixated on death, but carried shields into battle. If they sought a great death, why try to preserve their lives? There was another layer to their thinking: that death must come at the correct time and place. Shielding themselves made that day possible."/>
	<entry name="SmokeLauncherFlavor" value="I don’t know if you know this, but tanks are… big. Easy to hit. We rigged up smoke launchers on them to cover our retreats. Plenty of idiot operators thought they were invincible riding in the seat of a Crusader. The smart ones knew when to drop smoke and bug out."/>
	<entry name="StickyFoamFlavor" value="This stuff was vile. It smelled worse than the Malakim Destroyers who sprayed it on the battlefield. I guess when you’re as bad a shot as they were, you needed every technological advantage to hold down your enemy."/>
	<entry name="SurvivalTrainingFlavor" value="Strong soldiers saw value in sharing knowledge. If you lived this long, you’ve learned a thousand lessons the hard way. There was value in passing what you know to the next generation. I hope there’s still truth in that."/>
	<entry name="SystemOverloadFlavor" value="The Krypt Archai had some kind of… universal sabotage protocol. It didn’t make any sense, drove our techs up the wall. It seemed to work on weaponry by making ammo explode, but it could play havoc with networked systems, or choke Voice weapons on their own power. What was this thing? Where did it get this power?"/>
	<entry name="TakeCoverFlavor" value="I dropped behind cover on so many different battlefields that I started to get a taste for different kinds of dirt. Fresh farm soil has a wetness to it. Desert sand can lure you in with the taste of salt. And land where the Voice bled through… it made you want to spit until your mouth was dry."/>
	<entry name="TargetingRelayFlavor" value="The name was ironic. Sure, stand close to a Relay, you’ll get better targeting data. You also became a bigger target."/>
	<entry name="TameAbkluthFlavor" value="I was unsettled by how some humans learned to tame the Abkluth. If these monsters could be tamed, they could be… domesticated, right? I shuddered at the thought of feeding Abkluth on a farm, treating them when they fell ill, debating what feed to give them. They were monsters. I didn’t want them to feel our kindness."/>
	<entry name="TheOutsiderFlavor" value="Whatever body that the Voice spoke from, it never set foot on earth. It had a servant though. The Tribunal whispered about it, told us that it walked just on the other side of a thin veil. I knew the trio wanted to bring it through—they thought it was a gift for our world. I… disagreed. Loudly."/>
	<entry name="ThereIsHope" value="Hope. The Romantic never convinced me to believe in such foolishness. He could never describe a world after the war, but he believed in it anyway. There was strength in that. Cynics like me could only see what was right in front of our faces. He taught his troops how to look toward the future."/>
	<entry name="TimeShiftFlavor" value="I didn't see it happen often, but whatever force the Kriteria could tap into warped time itself. In those rare moments, this hulking machine carrying a god-like energy generator would burst across the land. Nothing was meant to move so fast—I worried it would be too useful, too efficient. That there would be a price to pay for warping time itself."/>
	<entry name="TuneFlavor" value="Mass-producing weapons left them with flaws, unfortunately. In the field, an Engineer could hack together short-term fixes that could make your rifle fire like it was the living embodiment of destiny. Then physics took their toll and you were left with interchangeable junk."/>
	<entry name="TunnelFlavor" value="Only that urge to hear the Voice’s call could send any creature back into the dirt. Could you imagine how deep the Worms went? How great the Earth’s pressure was on them? And then they would come roaring to the surface, their guts expanding as that pressure let up, ready to spew acid that could burn a man alive…"/>
	<entry name="ValhallaFlavor" value="When soldiers died around the Valkyria, they… connected to something, some thinning presence between our world and… another one. Maybe the next one. They drew power in that strength—our scientists guessed it was just a kind of euphoria state. But if you watched how they fought while under the influence of that connection… you’d believe in an afterlife too."/>
	<entry name="WhispersOfHarmonyFlavor" value="The Voice knew dark secrets of rebinding flesh and metal. Those who heard its whispers could make the most of them and more easily draw thinking creatures in under its influence. What does anyone want other than the promise that they’ll be safe? The Voice could make that promise—even if it knew it was a lie."/>
	<entry name="WhispersOfTheVoiceFlavor" value="The Voice must have been amused by our desperate attempts to research its presence. It strung along the Tribunal with whispers of different futures, possibilities that humanity hadn’t considered. Maybe this is what it did for the Acrin—maybe that’s why they came to kill our world."/>
	<entry name="WordsOfTheProphetFlavor" value="Turning an enemy into a friend is always a boon, but The Prophet had a talent for making soldiers reject their old masters. He knew such rejection could send a powerful message. It’s one thing for your followers to welcome new congregants, it’s another to see them praise your leader, and condemn their old ones."/>
	<entry name="AcquireTileFlavor" value="I couldn't believe we were still doing safety inspections and site surveys, all this pre-war nonsense. But the city planners knew what they were doing. What good was it to build something if it would just fall down again? They learned to work under heavy fire and harsh conditions to make sure it was safe to expand our territory."/>
	<entry name="ConstructRoadFlavor" value="I didn't realize how much I missed proper roads. Months of hauling ass in an Outrider made me used to bumpy rock and hard terrain. But getting that smooth path back helped me focus. Helped me focus on the enemy ahead—and protecting home that lay behind."/>
	<entry name="RemoveRoadFlavor" value="That's the thing about infrastructure—you can build it, but then your enemy might take it. When things got bad we'd send the Engineers out to begin knocking down roads while we gave them covering fire. If we played our cards right, our enemies would be stuck in the mud, exposed, and ready for us to rain hell down upon them."/>
	<entry name="NomadicLifeFlavor" value="Reavers know how to make the wilderness their own. They're skilled at taking the goods they pillage and turning them into supplies for a camp. Be careful if they set up one near your territory—it won't be long before a swarm of them comes crawling over the walls."/>
	<entry name="BreedDeformitiesFlavor" value="In the belly of a Shoch'itris you would find bubbling pools of organic matter. There should be something sacred about life begetting life like this—but there was nothing holy in here. This beast took the refuse of our world and scraped it back together for one last life as a weapon."/>
	<entry name="AbyssalRageFlavor" value="You've never known an anger like this. Humans feel rage because we find the world unfair. But the Voice could bring out something deeper. Something that fills its creations with a hatred of the universe itself. If you find yourself facing down such anger… run."/>
	<entry name="DarkCaressFlavor" value="Could you imagine the touch of those foul fingers? Picture a giant hand reaching down to brush your shoulder like a long-lost love? It dreams of that. It remembers such a sensation. And that desire is what you will feel when it reaches out for you in the heat of battle."/>
	<entry name="IncendiaryGrenadeFlavor" value="Alien, machine, human. All burned at a hot enough temperature. But the smells were different. The screams were different. No matter how you came into this world, being burned alive was a terrible way to leave it."/>
	<entry name="LogisticsExpertsFlavor" value="Supplies being hauled back from the outposts always had a habit of “falling off the back of the truck.” Command got tired of the losses and ordered us to round up experts who could monitor each shipment. They were ruthless. If they supervised your shift you weren't getting a wink of sleep until each piece of metal was hauled out of the earth and accounted for."/>
	<entry name="EyeOfZephonFlavor" value="ZEPHON was always watching you. Dead cameras came to life while clearing warehouses. It used seismographs to track troop movements. We knew how to dodge drones, but after a while we would stare up at the stars and wonder if that blinking light was a distant ball of gas—or one of its satellites snapping pretty polaroids of our position. "/>
	<entry name="DirectControlFlavor" value="We ambushed a patrol of ZEPHON's machines, hoping to scrap them for parts. One of them suddenly twitched violently and its circuits glowed a terrifying color I can't describe—before slaughtering a squad of Militia in a single stroke. I made eye contact with the thing and it felt like ZEPHON itself was looking back at me."/>
	<entry name="DarkPactFlavor" value="My heart thumped faster and faster in my chest as I scrambled away from The Anchorite's Dreameater. The blood of my troops—my friends—dripped down from its tentacles onto my face. I was counting down my final seconds but then the beast vanished in a burst of light. The Anchorite had let me live. He wanted me to tell the world about the beast—and that he'd unleash it if we dared to threaten him again."/>
	<entry name="TheFogFlavor" value="It was a death trap. They sent us in anyway. Even when pierced by our lanterns the fog crept in through our orifices and made our insides burn. The Acrin in the mist taunted us from a distance, laughing at how the mildewy air that made them glow with power was making us choke on our own bile."/>
	<entry name="ApotheosisFlavor" value="The stench was the first warning. If your Voice-touched enemy began to stink like a shit-covered corpse, you were seconds from being blasted by its blood and guts. A remote detonator would have killed its host quickly—but these unlucky bastards got to feel their insides rapidly rot before they blew wide open."/>
	<entry name="AntiparticlePurgeFlavor" value="Of course it was an old-world corpo that cooked up this device. Killing the forests to harvest energy? Comic book villain-level shit. Its only redeeming quality was that it worked equally well on Bleed scouring the planet's surface. Who knows. Maybe if you shrunk it down small enough it'd make for a good weed killer."/>
	<entry name="BleedCultivation" value="The Voice's whispers twisted our senses and our minds. One day everyone woke up and the alien plants of the Bleed smelled like honeysuckle. Our people wanted it to grow in their homes and bathe in its stench. I held it off, and watched our cities morph into twisted towers that could have come from another planet…"/>
	<entry name="DreamPrisonFlavor" value="30 Militants. Two Missile Teams. A Praetorian. That's how many I killed while the Dreameater took over my mind. I told Command I was brainwashed and had no memory of it but that was a lie. It fed me a vision of hunting deer in the woods. Downing them. Stalking them. Skinning them. Each one screaming for help as I plunged a knife in its ribs…"/>
	<entry name="UnearthlyPassageFlavor" value="The Voice cultists learned how to pierce the walls between worlds. You knew it was coming when a sour stink of rotting flesh came over you and the sky began to shimmer. A great claw would cut through the air itself. You had moments to run, and if you began to hear the hushed whispers of an Elect of Uzhodai you had seconds before it would flay you alive."/>
	<entry name="CastigateFlavor" value="Did the Voice's power work like the old fairy tales grandma bored me with. Did the cultists know “the true names” of things? When a giant monster screamed at you in a dead language—had it learned your true name? Who you really were? Or was it just some biological nonsense that made the intense pain shoot through your body?"/>
	<entry name="UzhodaisZealFlavor" value="Best way to cut down an Elect of Uzhodai was to go at it one-on-one. Swarm it with troops and it only seemed to grow more violent, more resistant to our blows. The creature seemed to feed on the fear of gathering men, but if you faced it with courage then it would wilt under your blade."/>
	<entry name="EndbringersReversalFlavor" value="I'd stolen scrolls that the Furtive Tribunal kept close and was minutes away from being caught by her soldiers. As the end came, I felt the pull of another world wash over me and I was sucked to a safe spot nearby. In the place I had stood was an Uzhodai worshiper, ready to slaughter the Tribunal's surprised troops."/>
	<entry name="UnholyHasteFlavor" value="Cr'la wasn't keen on the idea of “rest.” When its disciples commanded you to move, you MOVED. Like some other force took over your body and made you reach for your gun one more time, no matter how exhausted you were."/>
	<entry name="BionicImplantFlavor" value="Medic named Lucia once snuck up on me and shot one of these implants in my arm. Hurt like hell, nearly took a swing at her for it. “Toughen up you big baby,” was all she said. “Think of it as high-tech preventative care.” When I kept grumbling she smiled and smacked the shoulder she'd just stabbed with a needle. “Don't worry. I'll bill your insurance.”"/>
	<entry name="TheDeepWaysFlavor" value="Disciples of Cr'la were eager to lead those on the wretched roads that they mutilated themselves to walk. Their profane god knew how to compress a week-long journey into a matter of minutes. You felt every agonizing second while warping from point A to point B."/>
	<entry name="DecoyFlaresFlavor" value="Funny thing, flares. Pilots who deploy them don't see them. Missiles they're scrambling don't know what they are. The people who lay eyes on them are usually troops on the ground—the ones who have a second to look up and see them move like slow lightning through the sky."/>
	<entry name="TacticalNuclearMissileFlavor" value="There was a time when firing one of these would have been unthinkable. Good men would rather die than be the ones who pulled the trigger. The rubes. They thought they stood on the edge of the apocalypse. Once you're at the end of the world, speeding things up doesn't sound like a bad proposition."/>
	<entry name="OrbitalDeploymentFlavor" value="Assault troopers rocketing to orbit for long-range deployment came back down either terrified as shit or as the most serene motherfuckers you ever met on the battlefield. Some thought seeing Earth floating among the stars was the most beautiful thing ever. Others were terrified at just how small we were in this big black void of nothing."/>
	<entry name="InevitableEndFlavor" value="A Cr'la worshiper was talking my ear off about how he could see “the threads of life” that “connected every person to this mortal coil.” I was being an ass, asked if he could cut those threads and save us a heap of trouble. He reached out, pulled at something floating over my head and I hit the ground, choking. “I can,” he said. “Oh, I can indeed.”"/>
	<entry name="AtramentousAuraFlavor" value="The enemy was hours away from storming HQ. We were as good as dead. But, out of the blue, our comms burst with static and an iridescent wave appeared out of nowhere. We breathed it in. Felt sharper, faster, stronger. We held the fucking line."/>
	<entry name="BlackHoleFlavor" value="Something in humanity died when we began to rip apart spacetime itself. We saw reality as a machine that could be programmed. Black holes may be the darkest spots in the universe, but there’s nothing darker than a person who's decided it's time for them to play god."/>
	<entry name="InternalRepairStationFlavor" value="A group of aspiring young technicians came to me with a plan to install repair stations in our Marauder transports. Their superiors pushed back—called it a waste of time. I pointed out that there are plenty more spare parts close to the battlefield—and if the senior techs were so eager to run repairs, they could be assigned elsewhere. They relented."/>
	<entry name="ReconstructFlavor" value="Metal that healed like flesh? In the last days of the war, everything was a fever dream… I didn't bat an eye when ZEPHON's Titans sewed steel back together like raw meat. This was what it wanted, wasn't it? Machines that were truly alive? Maybe to truly live, you had to bleed…"/>
	<entry name="ExtirpateFlavor" value="We were safe. We had the shot. We were going to kill a Titan. All those facts fell apart when the beast raised its maw full of limbs and screamed right in our direction. It felt like tendrils gripped our armor and pulled us toward its fleshy mouth. Our time… was up."/>
	<entry name="SupplicationFlavor" value="A drunk engineer made her way down to our barracks, babbling about her work on the Provost. Talked about code written in languages she'd never seen. Functions that could command all in its presence to listen to its screeching lectures. The way she talked about them… they may really have been machines that spoke with… God? I'm not even going to think about that."/>
	<entry name="PandemoniumFlavor" value="All those fancy words for explaining how chips and singularity cores worked. I still don't understand them after all these years. But I knew how the Elohim worked. Heard them… purr with delight when a core was near. To them, a core was a treat, like catnip, made them hurl their missiles impossibly far."/>
	<entry name="HolyBondFlavor" value="The Provost's most divine trick… it made the machine seem like a Voice worshiper. There isn’t enough science in the world you can throw at me to explain how a golden light pouring from its eyes could absorb the pain. Wait. Hang on. Did it… was this a trick of The Voice after all?"/>
	<entry name="PestilenceFlavor" value="Another old trick of war. Rats. Plague carts. Catapults slinging corpses. The first horseman of the Apocalypse was Pestilence, after all. Face down a Fallen Orolos and you'd feel the mold spores choking you on the battlefield, making you wish the monster would just crush you already."/>
	<entry name="NightmareFlavor" value="Intel could never keep up with how many Phenaris Hunters were out on the battlefield. They weren't breeding, they were just… I don't know. Pulling a version of themselves in from another dimension? Fooling everyone, even the machines? I don't know. Too many monsters and too many tricks to keep in my head. I just wanted to rest…"/>
	<entry name="DreadShadowFlavor" value="Shadows. They were just shadows all along. Light bent to… do something, Christ. If one of the doubles slashed at your arm, it was still the claw of the original Hunter cutting into your flesh. Had to keep shooting. Just had to keep shooting and hope your futuristic energy gun could do something against a monster that could fuck with light itself."/>
	<entry name="SoundquakeFlavor" value="Holy fuck! Of all the ways you can get pinned down, this one… this one hurt. So much. A giant fucking monster pointing a cannon at you and blasting you with noise so intense it makes gravity stronger. My ears started bleeding and my bones felt like they were going to break… but without a scratch on me. We were already retreating… why did it need to stop us like this?"/>
