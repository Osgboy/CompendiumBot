Freedom has returned to the wasteland.<br/><br/>Your surviving comrades all gather round for drinks, asking each other what they'll do with the war over. “Whatever the hell you want!” you roar as you enter the room. “Build house. Start fight club. Knock down buildings. Just whatever you do, MAKE SURE NO ONE'S TELLING YOU DO IT!”<br/><br/>The cheers grow louder and louder.

I lied for all these years.”<br/><br/>“It's my fault,” he whispers. “My heresy brought us to defeat.”<br/><br/>He wails. You descend from the throne, a ceremonial knife hidden behind your back. You tilt the priest's head up and gaze into his eyes. “Please,” he says. “I beg your forgiveness.”<br/><br/>Then he sees the blade. His eyes widen. You slit his throat. Forgiveness has been granted.<br/><br/>When enemy troops burst into the hall, they find only the priest's body. The Great Speaker has already taken you to the next life."/>
