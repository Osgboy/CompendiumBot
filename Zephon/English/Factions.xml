Can't possibly be here, walking around in the aftermath. He saw the guns face him, heard the bullets fly. Felt the dull impacts, the transient, impossible pain, death. Didn’t feel an afterlife or anything like that. Just died quickly, painfully—and then found himself sitting on a bunk in the barracks, in webbing, gun on lap, like he’d just dozed off. Except the barracks were ruins and everyone else was gone or dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Some days he wonders if he's an angel.

All that survival training, all those military months in the mountains, swamps, moors, dead places of the world, all those hours of theory in the academy—has fitted him perfectly to be here. He doesn’t want to kill anyone who stands in his way—but he will know when he has to, and do it without hesitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He doesn’t care for factions—human, machine, other.

Let the bureaucrats fight for the right to rule. You try to find peace among your people by building houses and volunteering in refugee camps—how all great leaders should end their era of rulership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You end each day watching the sunset bathe the capital city in golden light. Peace is the color of an amber sky and the sound of your people sitting down for food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But today, that golden light slowly turns a shade of red. Your people's laughter falls silent, and your heart drops. Has the end of the world come again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“No,” the Voice whispers. “Just the end of this journey.”"/>

<entry name="RogueOperativeFlavor" value="When the sky fell, the Rogue wasn’t in the basements, bunkers and hidey holes with all else that remains of mankind. She’d grifted her way into a major biocorp’s HQ to get access to their server farm for her gang’s ends and ended up stuck there for the duration, living off vending machine food and hacking out all the corp’s dirty secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She’s not a natural leader, but she is a natural grifter. So when she emerged, it was backed by the remains of corp security. She quickly took charge of the remaining staff, promising that she’d use the firm’s bioaug tricks to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And she will survive, whatever the cost. She doesn’t give a damn about the Acrin—though she’s wise enough to fear their horrors and history, she’s skeptical of the Voice and thinks they’re too trusting to be a threat any longer. Other human survivors are more of a challenge, for sure. But her eyes are set on ZEPHON—the biggest mark of all. If she can get close, she’s convinced she can make it dance to her tune."/>
<entry name="RogueOperativeLostFlavor" value="You can still win this. There's always an angle. Sure the cities are on fire. Monsters roam the streets. But you weren't very keen on ruling a nation anyway. Your exit strategy is simple: get to the vehicle bay, get your Outrider, haul ass until you wind up in a town where no one knows your name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good plan. Simple plan. Doomed plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you can set one foot in the vehicle bay a gunshot rings out. It goes clean through your leg. Femoral artery bursts. Rips some of your favorite augments into shreds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You fall to the ground—and one of your own soldiers walks up to you. “Sorry boss,” she says. “I cut a deal. Nothing personal.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Shitty way to go,” you gasp. But the soldier doesn't hear you. You aren't even sure the words left your mouth. Your vision turns white. You'd cut a deal of your own to get out of this—but there's no one you can bargain with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you take your last breaths, a buried memory rises to the surface: you already made a bargain. One that will send you back around the loop one more time."/>

<entry name="UntoldProphetFlavor" value="The Untold Prophet first appeared to their followers as their bunker fell. Lit by the oscillating red glow of emergency beacons, words drowned by wailing klaxons, the child calmly beckoned for everyone to follow. While no one could recall this young stranger, all felt compelled by their presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For twenty-two days and twenty-two nights, the Prophet led them across the wasteland. The journey was a trial. Those that fled soon perished. Those that stayed, witnessed miracles everywhere the Prophet went. Supply caches refilled overnight, bandits wept and converted, and horrific beasts were gentled by the Prophet’s mere presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the twenty-second night, the Prophet stopped, looked around, then sat down. There they stayed, leading meditations and giving sermons, and their followers built a camp around them. More and more people came, attracted by rumors of the wise child, and the camp grew into a town, then a city, as their number swelled with new faithful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any notice the Prophet’s lack of aging or the odd way they tilt their head, as if listening to something only they can hear, none dare mention it. For despite their serenity, the child’s armies are fanatical—and storm across the distant pastures in the name of their Prophet."/>

The sound of distant artillery has grown silent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Great one,” the priest says. “I wish to confess my heresy.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You tilt your head towards him. He can't hear what you hear. Dark whispers describe how death will soon visit this hall. “I never believed in the Great Speaker. I lied for all these years.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“It's my fault,” he whispers. “My heresy brought us to defeat.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He wails. You descend from the throne, a ceremonial knife hidden behind your back. You tilt the priest's head up and gaze into his eyes. “Please,” he says. “I beg your forgiveness.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he sees the blade. His eyes widen. You slit his throat. Forgiveness has been granted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When enemy troops burst into the hall, they find only the priest's body. The Great Speaker has already taken you to the next life."/>
