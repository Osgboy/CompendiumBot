	<entry name="Interlude0Info" value="Your people hoped they would return to the surface and find untended wilderness—not a world of monsters and vile ZEPHON machines. Reports regularly come in of refugees who wandered too close to the Wardens' territory—and were slaughtered for their trespass.<br/><br/>What is ZEPHON doing in there? Ironically it is the monsters who know something about the machines. Your comms team is surprised one day to hear the voice of an Acrin leader—The Anchorite—broadcasting on an old AM radio frequency.<br/><br/>He sounds like a preacher whose voice would have once haunted the airwaves of the empty countryside. In his sermons, he proclaims that his people want peace. “To seek a new future, without the Voice,” he says. “To know it was the Voice who hunted humans—who hunted ZEPHON—not my people.”<br/><br/>His preaching sometimes descends to rambling. He mumbles about mysterious factories belching fire and smoke into the night. He mourns his people slain by the Wardens who guard them.<br/><br/>“To want peace, simple peace. Peace must light up the land like the sun rising over a glimmering ocean.” the Anchorite intones.<br/><br/>You listen to his sermon, keenly aware that if peace is a distant sunrise, there is still a long night ahead of you."/>
