We're only doing the absolutely necessary pop-up tips to be able to play (win introduction).

Text is shortest possible. Use simple words. Short sentences. Skip flavor.

Too many tips that pop-up means the player is interrupted, annoyed and stops reading all of them.

We can do longer explanatory tips that are only in the Compendium. E.g. Camera tip could have "More" that links to Camera (Advanced): arrows keys, mouse wheel, zoom, middle mouse rotate. Similarly for Combat.
