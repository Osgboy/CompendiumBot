	<!-- Flavor. -->
<entry name="AbhorrentFlavor" value="Oh mother. Never much of a negotiator. Maybe the others would have taken pity on her but… let's face it. Wasn't easy to feel pity when you saw her body. Maybe she let them take advantage of her? To take more than they gave?"/>
<entry name="AbkhanHoardFlavor" value="Somewhere buried deep in the brain of an Abkhan had to be an instinct of pure spite. The monsters hoarded food and supplies they didn't know how to use—they just knew that we needed them. That's more than just laying a trap. That's taunting your prey."/>
<entry name="AcrinAdvancementFlavor" value="Never count the Acrin out. They survived thousands of years in space. The blast of Fulcrum. The horrors of a ruined Earth. The Anchorite always has his eye on the long game… and dreams of a day when his people won't remember the trauma of war."/>
<entry name="AegyllanSightFlavor" value="The Aegyllan Worms were so tethered to the dark and damp that their sight began to weaken. Generation after generation, the other senses—smell, sound, touch—grew enhanced, but they thought they'd abandoned all need for their eyes. Fine enough for underground travel, but when war brought them to the surface, they made for poor scouts."/>
<entry name="AgileFlavor" value="Survivors who were fast on their feet became the best at hunting prey in rough terrain."/>
<entry name="AirFreightnetFlavor" value="Wasn't really anything like an “airport” anymore so we had cargo jets fly in and out of military airfields. Had a nice side effect: get even a few regular flights going between bases and everyone from merchants to well-wishing families came rushing in to squeeze extra cargo into your hangar. Gave people a sense of… normalcy, I guess."/>
<entry name="AlgaeUpgradeFlavor" value="Runoff from our farms sometimes poisoned the very soil we tried to grow food on. Our scientists were prepared for that—but they weren't prepared for what came next: Algae took root in the diseased soil. We realized we had a vile feedback loop on our hands—the more food we produced, the more Algae we could generate too. Humans and Voice cultists would both eat well."/>
<entry name="AmoetiasCaressFlavor" value="The Concordat sent kids out into The Bleed. Bastards. Dangerous work for anyone but something about the children's small hands let them dig out crystals they needed for rare Voice artifacts. You'd buy them. The blood on the surface would stain your hands. And we all knew where the blood came from…"/>
<entry name="AmoetiasEmbraceFlavor" value="The hooded Concordat agent drew close and whispered into my ear after we concluded a trade. “The Fulcrum's power was greater than we ever imagined… When its power washed over the planet's surface, it pulled wondrous objects through the veil of a parallel world.” I tried to pull away but he just grabbed my wrist. “You have heard their melody. And now you are ready to receive their blessing.”"/>
<entry name="AnnihilationProtocolsFlavor" value="Sometimes to get a killing machine up and running, all you’d need was just a little momentum."/>
<entry name="AntiAirFlavor" value="When defending attacks from above, we could fine-tune our weapons to predict how the enemy would behave. But troops on the ground could be unpredictable and erratic. Firing on them with the wrong type of weapon could do little more than blow out their eardrums."/>
<entry name="AntiGroundFlavor" value="During one brutal siege, I dropped in on a group of soldiers training a cannon on our enemy fighters. They would take turns rolling a pair of dice between each shot. I asked why. “Checking to see what happens more often,” they said. “Snake eyes or actually landing a fucking shot.”"/>
<entry name="AntimatterDiffractionFlavor" value="Do not ever go into battle thinking you are invulnerable. Antimatter tech made mincemeat out of too many good troops who’d started to think they were gods. But there was something… pleasing about breaking through that armor, locking eyes with your enemy, and seeing terror seep across their face."/>
<entry name="AntimatterPlatingFlavor" value="Armor is a thin wall you’d put up between yourself and the outside world. But walls can be knocked down. Antimatter plating could take hits like a willow waiting out a storm. You’d hit hard, you’d hit fast, and the armor would just move with the hits, absorb the energy, and leave your enemies exposed for the follow-up attack."/>
<entry name="AntimatterShieldFlavor" value="If we wanted our soldiers to have more protection we’d have slapped more armor on them. The Antimatter Shield didn’t just protect our troops, it gave them some much-needed zone control as well. Skilled groups of soldiers would team up and push enemies into everything from artillery fire to the Bleed."/>
<entry name="AntimatterUpgradeFlavor" value="Safety measures from old-world power plants slowed us down. So we built plants in the middle of nowhere to reduce casualty risk. Funny. The top brass who decided to throw safety out the window worked real hard to make sure they never went near these plants."/>
<entry name="AntiphonAtDaybreakFlavor" value="The monsters berthing in the Voice-drenched airfields bayed at the sun every morning. One of the grunts in my unit said she knew why. “It's a song. A song that rises to the sky and carves a path for them to fly through.” I blew it off. My squadmates didn't. Nothing seemed impossible that late into the war."/>
<entry name="AraneanCloakFlavor" value="The cloaking technology didn’t make Stalkers invisible. Those spikes on their back would warp the light around them, projecting a shape that wasn’t there. What looked like a direct hit would just turn out to be empty air. We were lucky it didn’t work well at close range."/>
<entry name="ArchaiConstructFlavor" value="The Krypt Archai's creations were made of material none of our techs could properly understand. I suspect this was deliberate. It tended to its own machines by using nanobots. It was willing to share its power with us—but by no means did it trust us."/>
<entry name="AreaFlavor" value="Piece of advice: don't stand so damn close together. Hell, don’t stand in the same county. Whether it's using bombs, laser blasts, or sick flesh magic shit, titan weaponry can flatten entire regions."/>
<entry name="ArtilleryFlavor" value="“It's simple fucking math Sergeant,” I said, trying to get this coward to charge through the enemy bombardment. “The cannon points up. The shot arcs up. Then it hits the ground. Between those two spots is the safest place to be for twenty square klicks.” He still didn't move. Or, he did, I guess. When his body went flying when the enemy pounded our position at sunset."/>
<entry name="AssaultTransportFlavor" value="Assault Transports were best used for urgent missions where you needed boots on the ground quick. No time to even land and unload—we'd just kick open the hatch and unhook soldiers from their safety harnesses. It made for a rougher ride—but this was war, not a luxury jetliner."/>
<entry name="AsymmetricArbitrageFlavor" value="The most profitable way to deal with black markets in foreign territories was to slip their goods across the border on the back of trade convoys. Like sucker fish riding on the belly of a shark—a little free ride that benefits them, but doesn't bother the bigger beast."/>
<entry name="BabellianBeaconFlavor" value="Sky fortresses erected on tall mountains could be seen for miles. By the time we were building them, the techs were cooking up ways to program machines through light itself. Pairing them together made sense. If every time a machine looked up it saw the fortress—it could sync with the rest of the network and feel like a part of a greater whole."/>
<entry name="BalancedProgressFlavor" value="War's a gamble, right? Can't place your bets down on one strategy. Sometimes it's worth spending coin to spread out your odds, help you turn on a dime if one plan goes south."/>
<entry name="BiologicalFlavor" value="We had a lot in common with the monsters we faced. They bled like us, breathed like us, and died like us. Humans were always good at hurting other humans. It just took a little creativity to hurt our enemies in the same way."/>
<entry name="BleedwalkerFlavor" value="The Acrin and their pets had a special connection to the Voice—the Bleed would make way for them as they crossed through it. I think they gathered near Bleed outbreaks because on the new hellish Earth, it helped them feel closer to home."/>
<entry name="BlightedFlavor" value="Everything decays. Voice cultists seemed to enjoy making things rot faster. Flesh. Metal. Dirt. Didn't matter. Creatures like the Orolos spread bile over the battlefield that rotted it all. You could clean it off but… Gods the smell. Even when it burned through metal it still smelled a corpse dipped in sewage."/>
<entry name="BlindedFlavor" value="In basic training, they blindfolded us, taught us to fight with our other senses. Great for self-esteem, not so much use against a tank. Or plane. Or gibbering Voice horror."/>
<entry name="BreachCollectorFlavor" value="You'd better believe a bidding war broke out when some hapless hacker wandered out of a Zephon shard with half the backdoor keys for Old World tech. Concordat hosted the auction, got all the players in the room to bid… then declared it would pay the highest price, kept all the tech for itself. What was it playing at?"/>
<entry name="BrokenFlavor" value="War is hell on the body, and devastating for the mind. Time and time again, I steeled myself against the worst nightmares a man could ever see. Others lacked that iron will. You could see it in their eyes, hear it in their breath. Death had already taken their souls, and their bodies would follow soon enough."/>
<entry name="BunkerExtensionFlavor" value="Building out the bunkers we held came with risks. The greater surface area made them a larger target for heavy weapons. But there was nothing to be done. Our armies were growing, and we needed space for every soldier we could spare inside these. It was our best chance at mounting a solid defense."/>
<entry name="BurningFlavor" value="Fire lingers. It was one of the first weapons mankind developed. It’s still one of the most important tools for our survival. Respect it, or risk being consumed by the flame."/>
<entry name="CannibalizeMachinesFlavor" value="I was jealous sometimes… these machines could fight and put themselves back together without any rest. Imagine if organics could fight like that? Every swing you took, it only made you stronger? It was only human of me to dream. At least that was something these machines could never do."/>
<entry name="CarrionGlutFlavor" value="“LEAVE THEM ALONE!” The rookie was screaming at a cloud of Ioks—our Ioks—dropping on a corpse to feed. Fuck. It was our medic. I'd seen those two sneaking off to lock lips when they thought I wasn't looking. The Ioks didn't care. One swiped at the kid when they tried to get close. I grabbed them… made her look away as they turned their lover into human jerky."/>
<entry name="CausalWellFlavor" value="A spiraling energy exchange whirled around the Acrin titan. The fingers on its flesh pulsed in and out, sucking the spirit out of anything—machine, human, or Voice cultist—that drew close. Unless it liked you of course. Then those fingers drifted over your skin, giving you a taste of the life it stole."/>
<entry name="ChipsUpgradeFlavor" value="If we wanted to enhance our Chip production, we had to make a hard decision. We screened the populace for the best minds possible—minds we could permanently integrate in the hardware of our Fabricators. I wanted to lie to them—let them live in ignorance until the last possible moment. But you can't go looking for the sharpest minds in your society, and expect them to be selectively dull."/>
<entry name="CityTileAcquisitionRange2Flavor" value="Stretch your HQ out too far and it might collapse under its own weight. Good leaders were careful, built up a strong foundation to stand on, then sped up expansion that turned small bases into mini metropolises."/>
<entry name="CityTileAcquisitionRangeFlavor" value="I didn't like how quickly we expanded. Smaller cities were easier to defend, and even easier to evacuate when the chips were down. But the architects told me that growth was inevitable. “Density breeds efficiency,” they said. “We can't waste any resources at a time like this.”"/>
<entry name="CliffFlavor" value="Mother nature made her own walls that shaped the battlefield. Tall cliffs couldn't be broken, and savvy leaders used them to mount a strong defense. But our enemies could safely snipe at us from the high rocks, or box troops into canyons where there was no escape. Know the terrain, or it will be used against you."/>
<entry name="CloseQuartersFireFlavor" value="Only undisciplined idiots sprayed bullets over long distance. You wanted to do maximum damage? Then you had to let them get close. Real close. And then you squeezed that trigger for dear life."/>
<entry name="CombatShieldFlavor" value="The head of our medical corps was reluctant to distribute these shields to those under their command. I cornered them one day to ask why. “When we carry these into battle… we look more like riot cops than healers. Will our people trust us?” I couldn't respond. I couldn't tell them we might have to task medics with keeping order."/>
<entry name="ConcussedFlavor" value="When your head pounded and all you could hear was a high-pitched whine, the best you can do was fire blindly and hope you’d hit something."/>
<entry name="ConcussiveFlavor" value="Not every shot needed to kill. Sometimes throwing off their aim was all you needed to survive."/>
<entry name="ConeFlavor" value="In the war's early days that idea of sky-high monsters breathing fire over miles and miles still seemed the stuff of bad movies we watched in the bunker. But then we'd encounter the Abkhan—a creature that could breathe out a blizzard that swallowed whole armies. I began dreaming of other terrors. Beasts that could breathe acid, radiation or lightning. It made me miss my old nightmares."/>
<entry name="ConstructionUpgradeFlavor" value="Time was already running out the second we brought our first cities online. The Engineers informed us they could speed up construction—but it would cost more power. “Make sure you can run that kind of voltage,” one engineer warned us. “If the electricity cuts out while a crane's hauling material—it might be you it comes crashing down on.”"/>
<entry name="ContagiousFlavor" value="Strike a Fallen Orolos with blade or bare hand and some of the cancer it was borne from stuck on you. If you were lucky, it would die out fast, only taking a chunk of flesh as it went. If you weren't, it would bore through skin, fat, and muscle. Probably wouldn't kill you instantly… But it might just be the thing that did you in."/>
<entry name="CorpseCitiesFlavor" value="Concordat operatives would whisper about scavenging bodies, digging through the flesh to find the most valuable pieces. Told them it was disgusting. Got weirded out when they said I do it too. “You pull apart the metal flesh of the land to find rewards… we do too.” They were talking about looting cities. Did they… think cities were alive once?"/>
<entry name="CorrosiveFlavor" value="A festering wound can make for a painful death—but machines don't become wounded. You could still poison their chassis, strip back the armor, and expose the vulnerable systems underneath. You just needed the right weapon for the job."/>
<entry name="CostOfConvictionFlavor" value="Con artists and cult leaders shared a common technique—if you can convince your audience they need you to survive, you'll have power over them. But the Prophet knew he had to tread carefully—one wrong step, one chance for his people to slip back to reality—and they'd run from him like rats fleeing a sinking ship."/>
<entry name="CrippledFlavor" value="When you couldn’t run, you risked becoming your own worst enemy. All of your muscles would scream at you to flee but you had to resist that temptation. You fought like it was your last day on the planet. Doing so let some of us make it to the next one."/>
<entry name="CripplingFlavor" value="It was much easier to secure a kill if your target couldn’t run away from you."/>
<entry name="CultExpansionFlavor" value="The Prophet's Cultist had it down to a science. When their leader laid claim to a city, they flooded it with zealots and proselytizers. It didn't matter how many converted to the cause. Plenty of non-believers kept their heads down, worried that their neighbor would turn them in for any half-uttered sacrilege."/>
<entry name="CullTheWeakFlavor" value="Apex predators hunt the most vulnerable to feed and survive. Throkos'--servants? monsters? creations?--were bottom feeders. Peeling the scum off our forces so Uzhodai or Surthodai's flesh-rending nightmares could target the bigger fish. Like ecosystems they teach you about in school. But gorier."/>
<entry name="CyberInfantryUpgradeFlavor" value="Tasked with increasing troop output, the Techs knew the only solution was to turn to more and more automated processing. They linked the Printers' operating units into a single network. The more of them you had in a city, the faster it optimized production… and the more control you handed over to a new artificial life form."/>
<entry name="CyberVehiclesUpgradeFlavor" value="The machines saw something in our designs that we didn't. They tried to leave us hints—but when we were blind to them, they took matters into their own hands. We arrived one day to find our facilities upgraded, now producing antimatter along with our heavy armor. That was the point we began to lose control."/>
<entry name="DamagedFlavor" value="I landed a lucky shot on the eye of a Stalker that had pinned me down. It kept firing as I moved to finish it off, but every shot went wide. Was it… screaming, as I approached? I'd taken away the only purpose it had: to kill with precision. It died spraying laser fire everywhere, hitting nothing. Its worst nightmare."/>
<entry name="DarkOmenFlavor" value="The Tribunal had a sixth sense for when it was in danger—and the Voice was happy to reveal how close its enemies were. That kind of recon capability could have saved lives if the witches had shared it with humanity. But they were selfish. They only wanted to protect the Voice."/>
<entry name="DeathshriekFlavor" value="Priests of Phenaris whispered about their master's most prime edict: that before they die they scream his true name in the tongue it was meant to be spoken in. Made me think of a grandmother I met in the slums, who warned against speaking the true name of the god she worshiped. A warning shared by her ancestors from thousands of years in the past."/>
<entry name="DecayingFlavor" value="Some creatures were not meant to linger in this world. Lived just long enough to drag someone back to the grave with them. Flesh would slough off their body and drip to the ground with every step they took across the wasteland. Like melting cheese."/>
<entry name="DefenseMatrixFlavor" value="Some machines could be programmed to be ever vigilant and always respond to enemy movement. Running those intense calculations came with a trade-off in power, but we slept slightly easier with that extra line of defense."/>
<entry name="DeflectorShieldFlavor" value="The escalation was unending. Every new weapon the techs handed us would be matched by something equally powerful and frightening out on the battlefield. We realized if we wanted to win, we would need to turn our enemy’s weapons back against them."/>
<entry name="DeformingFlavor" value="The Voice has the power to animate rapidly decaying flesh. It makes an abomination out of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth—a cycle that was never meant to run so fast and with such chaos."/>
<entry name="DimensionalEchoesUpgradeFlavor" value="An Elect of Uzhodai gave a sermon outside a Sealed Hermitage facility. Tendrils of Bleed wound their way up the building and the cries of the immured cultists turned into wails of ecstasy. The Bleed's power bound them to their supposed God—and more and more echoes poured out of the screaming souls inside."/>
<entry name="DimensionalReverberationsFlavor" value="Plangent Orolos were so connected to the Voice they could extract Dimensional Echoes from anything they killed. Why? How? Too late in the war… too much in my head to even try and explain it. Just warned our troops if this thing killed them, their very souls could be yanked out and fed to the war machine."/>
<entry name="DisputationFlavor" value="Troops of the religious sort told tales about spiritual leaders lashing kids with the whip when they showed even a shred of insolence. Provosts worked the same way. Strike them and they'd take it PERSONALLY. Their limbs would lash out, like a cracking whip, just to hurt the thing closest to it and gain any sense of control."/>
<entry name="DozerBladeFlavor" value="We stripped dozer blades off of old construction vehicles so that our heavy armor could clear out terrain. If we hadn't strapped them on, we'd have lost so many troops to thick forests and dense, tangled ruins. I think some operators preferred clearing out terrain to open combat."/>
<entry name="DragoonArmorFlavor" value="An Acrin shaman explained to me that forging Dragoon Armor was an ancient tradition that predated the Voice coming to their world. It was one of their last ties to a peaceful era. “The tools we enter the world with are the tools we will need when it comes to an end,” she said. I could only think about how from their earliest days, the Acrin must have been thinking about the apocalypse."/>
<entry name="EMPFlavor" value="Electromagnetic pulse-based weaponry was an oddly old trick for a new age. In the wars of the old world, military leaders were just worried about the damage to civilian electronic infrastructure. But what did we care now? We just needed to fry machinery as fast as we could."/>
<entry name="EmulatedMindAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="The Emulated Mind's core database contained exabytes of singularity research from Old World universities. When ZEPHON woke her up it literally birthed her with knowledge of black holes no one else could access… maybe the impossible calculations that could create an event horizon were what had first driven her so mad."/>
<entry name="EnergyUpgradeFlavor" value="The most extreme climates on planet Earth were packed with extremophile life forms that survived in impossible conditions. Our Techs found that some life deep in the most toxic swamps and buried under the arctic ice, could be used to fuel exponential energy production. Like pulling up fossil fuels from the earth—except the creatures hadn't yet been fossilized."/>
<entry name="EngineerLifeFlavor" value="“Life is cheap. I can make life with the snap of my fingers. What is difficult, is making life that fulfills a purpose. Humanity struggled with its purpose for ages. It's time I decided what is best for them.” —Artificer's Log: Date Unknown"/>
<entry name="EssenceSyphonFlavor" value="The Leviathan’s skin would harden with every life it crushed beneath its feet. The cultists thought Vorodai itself was rewarding the beast with each kill, like a treat you'd give to a favored pet. Little did they know…"/>
<entry name="ExcessiveBladesFlavor" value="All in the name, isn't it? Figured at some point the more saws you slapped on a Shredder the slower it would become. But nah. The fuckers looked overloaded, but they moved just as fast and cut even deeper."/>
<entry name="ExtortiveFlavor" value="The Chieftess wasn't stupid. She knew most leaders wouldn't give her a cent when she came calling. But she liked rattling her saber on the fences, looking for those who grew complacent at her demands. When they kept ignoring her… she knew they were vulnerable for a strike."/>
<entry name="ExtraPlatingFlavor" value="We didn't put high-caliber plating on mobile armor to get our people home safe. We did it because if we kept them alive for even a few seconds longer, they'd have the time to fire off a shot that could turn the tide of battle."/>
<entry name="FerventStrengthFlavor" value="The bodies of Uzhodai's most fervent worshippers were molded for long journeys in the black of space. What did that mean? Pour a thousand bullets into one, get the bone to start sticking out from the skin, and you could see up close how the tendrils of nerves and blood vessels rebound themselves to keep the body alive and fighting. There was no wounding these monsters. Just killing them."/>
<entry name="FiringPointsFlavor" value="When you're trapped in a tight box taking heavy fire, it feels good to hit back—just as long as you're doing it behind proper cover. Our techs worked hard to make sure firing points in our bunkers wouldn't compromise their integrity. It wouldn't do much good to let our soldiers fight like hell if it would bring the roof down on them…"/>
<entry name="FlyingFlavor" value="Getting skybound put you in the polluted air, but it let you traverse the bleak seas and jagged cliffs that defined the cracked Earth. The view was probably better before our planet became a poisoned nightmare."/>
<entry name="FoodUpgradeFlavor" value="Some Techs who deserved a hell of a pay bump developed a chemical solution that would clean up fertilizer from the water. That made the area around our greenhouses some of the most unpolluted places on the surface. Schools of fish would gather in these spots, eager for fresh conditions—and giving us some desperately-needed food supplies to keep our people fed."/>
<entry name="FortificationFlavor" value="Walls didn't make you feel safe. They just felt like a ticking clock. Every “thud” of cannonfire hitting a fortification was a countdown to when the enemy would inevitably break through. You could shore them up, patch them as best you could—but any way you sliced it, all walls were meant to fall."/>
<entry name="FortressArmamentFlavor" value="The Emulated Mind was a particularly paranoid leader. She wanted to make sure ZEPHON or anyone else couldn't harm her. So she crafted a special cannon—never shared its specs with any other faction. It packed a hell of a punch—but I don't think she ever realized it also put a huge target on her back."/>
<entry name="FurtiveTribunalAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="The Tribunal revived an Old World tradition for those entering the Sealed Hermitage. After the cultists were sent in, attendants would pump a combination of algal gasses and toxic dust into the Hermitage as friends and family watched and wailed. Maniacal laughter and blood-curdling screams both sang from the walls within. Consecration? Funeral? I stopped caring what they called it and just tried to block out their cries."/>
<entry name="FusionWarheadFlavor" value="“Let me get this straight,” our chief weapons engineer said to me. “The tactical nuclear missile needs to do *more* damage? Is 50 kilotons not enough?” I really didn't feel like arguing. I showed her recon photos of a prototype Titan we'd be fighting within weeks. She gawped at the size. “Against that?” I replied. “50 kilotons is definitely not enough.”"/>
<entry name="GluttonyFlavor" value="I used to have sympathy for the finer tastes of the Honorable Aristocrat and his people. In time I grew furious with the waste. He'd never budge on how he portioned food—always making sure fine dishes were available to all. Rationing was an afterthought. Maybe there was a history there. A time in the old world when all he could eat was gruel. Perhaps… I was too harsh the last time I spoke to him."/>
<entry name="GravitationalCompressionFlavor" value="The Earth pulls against larger objects with greater force and with new technology available to us, we could make its might our own. The bigger our enemies came, the louder the noise they made when crashing to the ground."/>
<entry name="HammerheadProtocolsFlavor" value="Why did ZEPHON make a weapon that would never shoot first? Was it to teach us a lesson? Were we an experiment? For all we knew this could have been a happy accident, something it was content to let our best minds puzzle over."/>
<entry name="HammerheadTargetFlavor" value="A code-savvy commando once dumped a Hammerhead CPU after a firefight. She told me that these drones build themselves a little feedback loop where each attack sends data back about the target’s vulnerabilities, and it’s able to calibrate its munitions after every attack. Don’t let them get too many shots in."/>
<entry name="HasharetExchangeFlavor" value="Weird message from The Concordat came in. “We are pleased to learn you have crossed the Hasharet threshold” it cooed over the comms terminal. Machines in our command center began flickering—it was transmitting a code as we spoke. “You now have access to cyberware we held in reserve for those truly seeking to… transcend.”"/>
<entry name="HashmallimInstabilityFlavor" value="You never wanted any machine to be damaged, but Hashmallim Hosts were particularly sensitive. If these things took a pounding, the Graviton Projector would play havoc with their programming."/>
<entry name="HeadquartersAccuracyUpgradeFlavor" value="There was a quick, cheap way to improve the accuracy of headquarters' missile defenses: recon troops that could radio enemies' positions. But soldiers sent out there were at the mercy of… any number of horrors. So we found those already condemned to death and offered them a deal: endure a tour on the perimeter and their sentence would be commuted. I can count the number of survivors on one hand."/>
<entry name="HeadquartersAlgaeFlavor" value="In the cellars underneath our headquarters, we found a cabin, sitting in a dank, empty chamber. If you followed the Voice cultists inside you'd find a single room furnished with the forgotten belongings of an old man. The cultists would dig at the cracks in the floor, where Algae grew alongside the mold. And if you looked out the window, you saw not the walls of a cellar, but the color-shifting sky of another world."/>
<entry name="HeadquartersChipsFlavor" value="The manufacturing plants for Chips were constructed with direct hookups to the central computers at headquarters. Data from the machine flowed out to the factories—it was the only way to mimic ZEPHON's network. But the Chips sent something back. We began finding glowing packets of silicone growing around headquarters. While we were making Chips, the Chips… were making something too."/>
<entry name="HeadquartersGrowthFlavor" value="The midwife's harsh words made me doubt the decision we made. “Pregnancy is already body horror,” she coldly told us. “Mothers see their appendages swell. Ligaments and teeth will loosen. Rashes will consume the skin. And you want to speed that process up?” Telling her it was a mere 17 percent increase did nothing to change her mood."/>
<entry name="HeartfeltLossFlavor" value="I wish I'd had the heart to teach the Romantic about the harsh reality of leadership. The Romantic knew how to keep spirits high in his troops, but he never seemed to grasp how far they could fall. When you cherish and love the soldiers around you, their loss—or the threat of their loss—will hurt even harder."/>
<entry name="HeartlessArtificerAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="The Artificer smiled at me as she hooked up a damaged ZEPHON core to the Antigrav Assembler. “You see old friend,” she said, ignoring the machine’s violent electronic klaxons. “Integrating this core will increase the production speed of our assemblers. But really… I just wanted to hear the sound of ZEPHON's scream.”"/>
<entry name="HeavyFlavor" value="Heavier weapons needed time to set up and calibrate a targeting solution. Firing them while on the move was a hell of a gamble. Some unlucky troops could find themselves addicted to those long odds. The smart ones knew how to play it safe for a sure shot."/>
<entry name="HeroFlavor" value="Good generals knew the danger of letting anyone stand out from the crowd. Our soldiers needed to be faceless, so they could die and we would feel little. But some soldiers defied that logic. They rose from the muck to become key pieces on the battlefield. Losing them always hurt the most."/>
<entry name="HitAndRunFlavor" value="Soldiers and criminals have more in common than you think. Crooks know if you stand still the authorities will snatch you up. Soldiers know if you freeze at the sound of gunfire, you'll get a bullet to the head. No settling down. No getting close to anyone. Just being always on the move."/>
<entry name="HollowWarlordAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="Was the Warlord a mechanic in the old world? Maybe a desk jockey at some speed demon manufacturer? He knew the ins and outs of a Scrambler like no one else in the wastes. Tuned some up in his spare time, taught others to as well. Never answered my questions on it. Seemed just happy to put more bikes on the road."/>
<entry name="HollowWarlordAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="Too many restless young people who wanted nothing more than to kill, kill, kill… I was one of them, early on. Alone, angry, afraid but I didn't want to admit it. Plenty of us didn't want money or food. Just a warlord to point us toward someone we could take it all out on."/>
<entry name="HolopatterFlavor" value="Oldest trick in war is covering yourself in branches so it's harder to see you in the forest. The techs cooked up holographic cloaks that also worked well in dense ruins. Couldn't keep you hidden forever, but bought you a few extra seconds to line up the perfect shot. Don't need to hide if the thing you're shooting is dead."/>
<entry name="HonorableAristocratAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="“A chief… nutritionist?” I was stunned. But the Aristocrat said I could accept it or find a new boss. His theory was that a dedicated food scientist managing our supply lines could ensure every soldier ate a meal that maximized their job function. And I'll be damned if it didn't work. I certainly ate better fighting for him."/>
<entry name="HonorboundFlavor" value="The Aristocrat could be a pain in the ass, but he was one of the few grifters in the wastes who was looking out for you. If you signed a trade deal with him—even a bad one—he sung your praises to the markets, made you look like a respectable partner. Make deals like that, and you'll bring plenty of friends close. And your enemies won't know they're in your net until it's too late."/>
<entry name="HorrifyingFlavor" value="Fear was supposed to keep you alive. But how could you fight for survival if all you could perceive was blood rushing through your ears? It could claw at you, drag you down and leave you helpless—the perfect victim for a creature that hungered for your blood."/>
<entry name="HoveringFlavor" value="The tactical purpose of low-level flight is to launch assaults over normally impassable terrain. But there was a morale value too. All beings, organic or mechanical, seemed to take thrill cruising so near to the ground."/>
<entry name="HumanInfantryUpgradeFlavor" value="The armies of the old world left plenty of lessons for us in the new one. To bring in more soldiers, we dispatched recruiters to our poorest communities—not to conscript, but to entertain. To make promises. To tell lies that would bring the desperate to our doorsteps. Plenty of those recruits became great soldiers. Far more made for useful cannon fodder."/>
<entry name="HumanOperationsUpgradeFlavor" value="We were in danger of losing access to the remaining satellite networks—no way we could keep up with all the AI crawling across the earth. One hacker in our ranks had a solution: she scrapped all our old access protocols, built new commands using programming languages so old no other techs knew about them. “The whole world used to hang on shit like this,” she said. The AI could never crack it."/>
<entry name="HumanVehiclesUpgradeFlavor" value="One frustrating day, an explosion rocked one of our key factory lines. The error was human in nature—but with all the workers in the room dead, we had no idea if it was sabotage or a simple mistake. It was cold calculus that led us to replace the workers with machines—fully automating our factories. There was a heavy price to pay. We made clear we lost trust in their loyalty. And they would make clear: they'd lost trust in our leadership."/>
<entry name="IgnoresCoverFlavor" value="There’s nothing more frightening than when you realize the wall you thought was keeping you safe just made you a bigger target."/>
<entry name="ImmobilizedFlavor" value="Our enemies pinned me down on the battlefield on plenty of occasions. I've been injured, trapped by the Bleed, frozen with strange technology, you name it. I watched good soldiers panic in those moments—they tried to make peace with their gods, begged for mercy, or fight like hell to escape. When I was trapped like that, all I could think was “there is still work to be done.” That's how I made it this far. There is still so much to do."/>
<entry name="ImmoralFlavor" value="The Artificer knew her actions would repulse people. She had no interest in how others thought of her. Perhaps she literally couldn't. But they followed her anyway—followed her burning-bright vision of the future."/>
<entry name="IndependentFlavor" value="The Rogue Operative liked surrounding herself with free-thinkers and loudmouths—people who wouldn't hesitate to speak their minds. A crew like that wasn't as loyal as true soldiers, but the Operative was fine with that. She didn't need sycophants—she needed the best the wasteland had to offer. That was her path to victory."/>
<entry name="IndirectFireFlavor" value="Firing without line of sight meant putting faith in a higher power. Maybe it was a computer. Maybe the Voice. You were in a duel with something you could not see, and you needed all the help you could get."/>
<entry name="InfluenceUpgradeFlavor" value="The rushing rivers were still the best way to trade goods and share news—merchant crews and haulers moved much faster when they glided on the water's surface. We wanted word of our strength to spread across the land—and word travels fastest on the lips of sailors bound for the nearest tavern."/>
<entry name="InterminableFlavor" value="ZEPHON's cities spread over great distances. If you were to see them from above, from the cockpit of a Corsair, your mind would trick you into thinking there were patterns in the sea of circuitry… but there was no meaning. No intent we could derive. ZEPHON just spread."/>
<entry name="JudgementFromAboveFlavor" value="“Judgment from above.” The only ones in need of judgment were whatever dipshit commander put their armies on lower elevation than an artillery unit. Techs wanted to babble about hypermechanical bullshit when they saw how hard our unit got hit but there wasn't anything more to it than simple physics. But hey, no one listens to me anyway…"/>
<entry name="LargeFlavor" value="Bigger creatures and machines could take a pounding, but they grew weaker the more parts of them you stripped away."/>
<entry name="LargeSplashFlavor" value="Some of our enemies thought they could overwhelm us with numbers—like ants, they'd swarm over our territory in a bid to drag us down. How beautiful it was, when we realized we could squash them beneath our boots—wipe out so many irritating creatures with one strike."/>
<entry name="LaserFlavor" value="Nothing poetic in using light as a weapon. All light is a weapon. The sun burns the body, the floodlight breaks your cover and the dim bulb of an interrogation chamber can break your mind. Laser tech was at least honest. It told you what it was going to hit — and more importantly, where it was coming from."/>
<entry name="LeashedFlavor" value="Want to stare death in the face? Find the home of a particularly nasty predator. Take a long walk around its territory and wait until the hairs go up on the back of your neck. Keep on your side of the line. Make eye contact with your stalker and feel your heart pump faster and faster. That's the bridge between this world and the next."/>
<entry name="LeaveNoManBehindFlavor" value="The Fallen Soldier's obsession with death made him so eager to keep every one of his troops alive. But devotion has its costs. Every life you save, every rogue soldier you bring in from the wastes, is another mouth to feed. He should never have been so… sympathetic. I considered it his sole weakness."/>
<entry name="LifeStealFlavor" value="You couldn’t steal souls. But some creatures fed on them—your life force would become a battlefield snack, an MRE for the monstrous. I thought everyone was fighting to survive. But this brave new world of ours gave birth to a new kind of predator: one with a taste for the spark of survival."/>
<entry name="LifestyleImplantsFlavor" value="I thought gathering around a table for a meal with friends was what made this war worth fighting for. But when the nutrient implants came in, people were so eager to abandon the mess halls, instead snacking between shifts on rocks, metal… dirt. I ate alone. I didn't even want to throw away the shitty taste of the MREs."/>
<entry name="LowPowerFlavor" value="You had to get used to the rhythm of using a laser weapon. Shoot. Recharge. Repeat. Just one, two , three—like you were learning how to dance. Shoot, recharge, repeat. Shoot, recharge, repeat. Shoot… recharge… repeat…"/>
<entry name="LoyaltyUpgradeFlavor" value="Our hologram library had maybe a few dozen films on file. Command worried the troops would get bored or be driven to mutiny if we played them on a loop. But in hard times, everyone just wanted a good story. Something to make sense of the world."/>
<entry name="MarketDefluctuationFlavor" value="You want me to explain money shit? If I could do that I wouldn't be here, I'd still be in the best bunker you could buy before the war. Terminals that predicted markets to score the best price, “supply and demand…” I thought we left all that behind. But war has a way of making capitalism come crawling back."/> 
<entry name="MassiveSplashFlavor" value="Time slowed as a massive explosion loomed over us like a tidal wave. A wave the size of a building that heaves over your ship and prepares to plunge it to the depths. At least those caught in the blast died quicker than the slow torment of death by water."/>
<entry name="MechanicalFlavor" value="You know what’s funny? People make machines to solve complicated problems. But on the battlefield, a machine becomes a problem to solve. Sometimes it took special skills to bring them down. Sometimes you just needed a bigger machine."/>
<entry name="MeleeFlavor" value="I know in the old world, humans would craft arts and disciplines of this kind of combat. But it all boiled down to the same thing: a burst of adrenaline and swing of a weapon did more to keep you alive than—forms, or sparring, or made-up ranks. Every living being knows how to hurt another—you just have to get close enough to make it happen."/>
<entry name="MilitantLegionFlavor" value="“There's strength in numbers, and survival of one depends on the survival of many.” I couldn't argue with the old veteran telling me to centralize our forces. Isolationism killed his people off one by one out in the wastes. He saw what I couldn't, that the world was coming together again for a war unlike anything we ever knew."/>
<entry name="MilitaryBackgroundFlavor" value="The Fallen Soldier's memories may have been scrambled when he first woke up but all his fighting instincts were intact. When it came time to scout the wastes, he knew digging up an Outrider would do more good than having grunts crawling through the darkness. It gave him an edge—just the barest edge—in the early days of the war."/>
<entry name="MilitaryBackgroundUpgrade2Flavor" value="The Watchmaker Yetunde delivered three code-locked boxes to the Fallen Soldier, saying they were gifts from “a mutual friend.” The second one read “Punish any who dare stalk your trail. Leave them limbless and screaming in the dirt.” Inside the box… plans for stackable mines."/>
<entry name="MineralsUpgradeFlavor" value="I did everything I could to avoid the cliffside dig sites. Passing through a canyon riddled with holes… I couldn't help but feel like something was calling to me from them. Something that wanted me to crawl deep into the planet's core and find a new kind of peace. Did the Aegyllan Worms feel that same presence? Or was this… something else?"/>
<entry name="MobileHardpointsFlavor" value="Having what was basically a miniature bunker in your kit was a lifesaver—if you had time to rig it up. Too many good men and women died thinking they could just drop it in the ground and it'd save them."/>
<entry name="MultiSpectralScatteringFlavor" value="Only the AI and its minions had true cloaking tech. Free-thinking humans like us had to design stealth tech the old-fashioned way—with a Voice-ready twist. Upgraded panels on our bombers shot out light that scrambled sensors on machines and gave any organics that looked at them one hell of a migraine."/>
<entry name="MysticismFlavor" value="The witches of the Tribunal were kind enough to not kill the first scientists who questioned their mystic knowledge. But they issued a clear ultimatum: The Voice's word was not to be questioned. Any heresy would be met with death. Techs and researchers in their ranks heard them loud and clear. The smart ones defected—and the sycophants stayed."/>
<entry name="OblivionUpgrade2Flavor" value="If “Oblivion's” power was like gaining control of lightning, “Extinction” was mastering the entire storm. The Emulated Mind became a god of old, perched atop her mountain, hurling depleted uranium across the land like thunderbolts. Children are taught to fear such gods. We had to learn how to serve one."/>
<entry name="OblivionUpgradeFlavor" value="When I was a young fool, gossip went around; of a scientist, a genius, who died attempting to fulfill that old billionaire dream of living forever by uploading herself. It didn’t work, of course-the giant machine was inert, unmotivated, left operating as a curiosity. Until ZEPHON found it and brought that mind to life, focusing its will as a weapon against the invading Acrin. In time, its—I should say, ‘her’—her will could stretch for miles, a thought could snuff out an enemy half a world away. A good reason not to gossip anymore…"/>
<entry name="OnFireFlavor" value="I dreamed frequently of being set aflame. Every time it came I felt my nerves erupt with pain, then disintegrate into nothingness. Did you know all noise fades into this thin crackling as your eardrums burn away? Every time I thought I'd forgotten the sensation, it would come again. I knew it was no dream. Someone… somewhere, wished me to be bound in flame."/>
<entry name="OutpostFlavor" value="If you're going to hold your ground, find the right ground to hold. Years of wars and scavenging left plenty of defendable positions scattered across the battlefield. When the enemy was breathing down your neck and you needed a space to make your stand, you ran for spots like these."/>
<entry name="OverchargableFlavor" value="Juicing up our most advanced weaponry came with a price—the discharge could do nasty things to any life form, biological or mechanical. But every good fighter is willing to leave a piece of themself in the arena if they walk away the victor."/>
<entry name="OverchargedFlavor" value="We learned early how to pop off the Gauss safeties—just click the switch three times and hold it down. Then came the glowing fumes that made us all high as kites. Finally the front line grunts had real power. Even the burns that came with it felt so, so good."/>
<entry name="OverheatingFlavor" value="There were no safety protocols in war. We discovered otherworldly new forms of energy and used them to fuel devastating weapons and machines. Push any of them past their limit and the energy would break containment, burning their operator. Sometimes that was the price of victory. Often it was just a waste."/>
<entry name="ParticleInterferenceFlavor" value="The Krypt Archai's particles would stick with a target even if it got away. They wouldn't inflict injury, but they were viciously engineered to interfere with any healing or repair efforts. The Archai it seemed, wanted its victims to linger in pain."/>
<entry name="PenanceFlavor" value="Oh those Provosts didn't respect their commanders any more they did the troops around them. Their resource needs were astronomical, but if you tried to mitigate them they'd lash out at you. “The price for our service is HIGH,” they'd roar through blown-out speakers. They bent the knee, but demanded a high price to do so."/>
<entry name="PerimeterRangeFlavor" value="Trial, error, and too many dead scouts helped us clock just how far ZEPHON's energy defenses could reach. Get too close to the city and you'd be pulverized. If Command had just given us artillery from the start, we could have saved so many lives…"/>
<entry name="PhantasmFlavor" value="Dreameaters belonged to another world. They'd just been pulled through to slaughter people in ours. Sometimes you'd fire three rounds into one… and watch the last bullet pass right through like they were just air."/>
<entry name="PilgrimOfTheVoiceFlavor" value="The last step to becoming a true disciple of Cr'la was a days-long journey through the wastes. No food. No water. No protection from the sun, the Bleed, or anything else. When they returned and were ready for the field, their six feet would bleed this filthy yellow gunk, shredded by debris that cut deep into their bleached flesh."/>
<entry name="PopulationLimitUpgrade2Flavor" value="Vile. Inhuman. Treating people like meat just to save space. Putting people side-by-side on cots, sure, that's how you get through hard times. But stunning and hanging them? Like beef in a freezer? Anyone who uses this tech is damned to hell."/>
<entry name="PopulationLimitUpgradeFlavor" value="One of those damned Watchmakers appeared out of nowhere during a power shortage to give us plans for this—toy. It was like a puzzle box with glowing lights, somehow sensitive to the user's mood. If you were relaxed—no, *happy*—and playing with it… the damn thing would generate power. The first time I took one home, I swear I caught a glimpse of someone—or something—watching me out of the corner of my eye."/>
<entry name="PracticalRomanticAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="Tech wasn't the Romantic's specialty—but I caught him one day scribbling improved shielding formulas for our champions. “She whispered to me in my dream,” he muttered. “A queen of the old world, the old continent. She…” He trailed off and kept writing. I don't think long-dead royals were the ones sharing advanced technology through the power of dreams."/>
<entry name="PracticalRomanticAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="The Concordat hated bargaining with the Practical Romantic. He'd wander into their tents and give their agents hell—always knew what items were the real deal. Could pick out the junk, the fakes, and shame them into haggling on the knockoffs. “Amateurs,” he'd mutter. “I grew up stealing from smarter shopkeepers.”"/>
<entry name="ProfusePropagationFlavor" value="If Ioks weren't sent out to die they'd breed forever. Cultists whispered about how they had to keep the population in check—but some pushed the limits. What was the harm in breeding one or two more monsters to win the war? Still, even with one more popping out in a swarm… it still seemed to make the skies all the more darker."/>
<entry name="PullingFlavor" value="Like watching old movies on the lazy boy. The hero gets dragged to certain doom and their lover dives in, to save ‘em. ‘Cept I’m watching a house-sized Abkhan, all muscle and teeth, and a Voice Titan is pulling it in, munching on it like popcorn. And I ain’t doing shit to save it."/>
<entry name="QuarryFeedFlavor" value="What ZEPHON's Titan saw, all machines saw. The ones nearby at least. And they clambered to get close to it… connecting to its network, linking to all the other machines—it was the only time I saw them experience what humans feel singing together around the campfire, or in a church: euphoria."/>
<entry name="RaidersFlavor" value="Had the bad luck to be held prisoner in a Reaver camp once. I watched them gather like flies around a corpse, fighting for scraps and even killing each other as the camp grew too crowded. When everyone seemed ready for mass murder, that's when the Chieftess sent them out on the hunt."/>
<entry name="RailgunRoadsFlavor" value="Every second counts in war. Especially when giants walk the Earth. In the final days our engineers laid down railgun track you could quickly mount anything up on—machine, monster, supersoldier, you name it. You'd lock in, hold tight, and try not to black out under the force of 5-7gs."/>
<entry name="ReaverAdvancementFlavor" value="The Chieftess was manic, but savvy. Ran circles around us, stealing our gear, distracting us from her scheming. Always stepped her game up another notch. You'd think she and her Reavers were outmatched… and then one would sneak up on you, yank your advanced helmet off, and slit your throat."/>
<entry name="RegenerationFlavor" value="Sometimes I'd overhear scientists debating how creatures from the Acrin homeworld could heal so efficiently. They'd debate if we could use it to save human lives—or extend them. I made clear if they ever learned how to recreate this healing factor, that we would first use it for our troops before the civilian populace. I worried we would have too many mouths to feed."/>
<entry name="ResearchUpgradeFlavor" value="It took some time, but our researchers came up with methods and processes to safely study creatures and plants from off-world. They requested the construction of dedicated stations for such research. We had to invest in them. Bringing such creatures into our regular facilities often had fatal outcomes."/>
<entry name="ResourceNetworkFlavor" value="The Emulated Mind must have connected to some ZEPHON database in her exposure to the net. She had detailed inventories available of all outposts we encountered—her scouts could leave no stone unturned, bring home every resource hidden from prying eyes. It was one of the few upsides of her painful genesis."/>
<entry name="RestlessFlavor" value="It was embarrassing, really. To watch a squad of Militants waste ammo firing shots off and drunkenly hooting and hollering. The Warlord looked equally enraged as we watched the spectacle. “This is the kind of soldier you attract,” I reminded him, as a bullet ricocheted off the wall by my head. He needed to keep them moving, keep them fighting—or else they'd tear everything up in frustration."/>
<entry name="RevealingFlavor" value="Oh there was so much to learn when you peered out into the darkness. The Voice had its way of finding secrets and the AI had their own. But all of us went looking out in the world for the same reason—to survive, to grow and to see our enemies before they could see us."/>
<entry name="RogueOperativeAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="Old world corpos strung governments along with promises of AI that would “synergize” infantry units. Like all that other AI crap, it was a bunch of junk. The Rogue Operative somehow got it working for cybernetic ground troops. Just needed troops with a little less free will…"/>
<entry name="RogueOperativeAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="One trooper I bunked with—long, grey-haired fellow who read too many books—called these new camo suits “a ghillie suit for the end times.” Laden with what looked like junk, but was actually high-tech adaptive camo. We used it to nestle into the crevices of downed machines, looking like little more than rusted pieces of our dying civilization."/>
<entry name="ScavengerFlavor" value="The Romantic was definitely the “waste not want not,” type. I think he still was haunted by those long nights in the bunker, desperately yearning for any scrap of food or supplies that could save his people. He rarely let on, but sometimes I saw him reviewing the reports of scavenged resources and I would see this look of mourning cross his face."/>
<entry name="SelfDestructFlavor" value="There was no escaping it. Some weapons we forged needed to kill their wielder to be effective. Troops tasked with carrying such armaments were given strict psychological screenings between missions, and drones were only dispatched on suicide runs when we could spare the resources. There's always a high price to pay with this kind of warfare—you had to make sure the payoff was worth it."/>
<entry name="SentryProtocolsFlavor" value="Machines that wandered the wasteland didn’t care whose flag you marched under. They did care if you entered their line of sight and, if they were programmed to do so, they’d open fire without hesitation. You couldn’t even squeeze in a friendly “hello.”"/>
<entry name="ShakenFlavor" value="A rattled soldier was a more vulnerable soldier. If you'd seen the horrors of the wastes, your hands might tremble instinctively the next time you picked up a weapon and you'd be slow to move when enemy fire rained on your position."/>
<entry name="ShieldDomeFlavor" value="New shield tech for our headquarters did a hell of a lot for civilian morale. When you stood under that glowing bubble you felt like the outside world couldn’t hurt you. On patrol, though, I'd look at the city from a distance and it didn't… you know… feel, like a shield. It looked like a snow globe. Beautiful. Shining. Fragile. Waiting to be broken."/>
<entry name="ShoulderPlateFlavor" value="Our techs didn't hit on this armor—the Enforcers did. One of them kicked in the door on a strategy session and unceremoniously dumped a prototype version of the armor on our war table. “Make more of these” was all he said before leaving the room."/>
<entry name="SingularityCoresUpgradeFlavor" value="Never try to explain quantum mechanics to a rank-and-file jarhead. You'll wind up saying something stupid like “Quantum Manipulators make other Quantum Manipulators cheaper because the Quantum Manipulator perceives the new Quantum Manipulator.” And then you'll wonder where the hell your life went this wrong."/>
<entry name="SlowPrimingFlavor" value="These weren’t quick weapons—poor fare for sentries who needed to react at a moment’s notice. But if you had time to draw on your target, you’d hit them with a shot they’d never forget—if they lived."/>
<entry name="SniperFlavor" value="The first snipers took their name from the cruel act of shooting birds in colonized territories. Our snipers faced far more worthy prey."/>
<entry name="SpiritOfMankindFlavor" value="Couldn't tell you if people are good or evil. But good leaders can make them good. Show your people what you'd sacrifice for them and they'll daydream of what they'd sacrifice for each other. Gotta make the most of it while everyone's hearts are something close to pure."/>
<entry name="SplashFlavor" value="Some weapons don’t just hit the target, they take out their closest friends too."/>
<entry name="StealthFlavor" value="Staying in the shadows could keep you safe. It also let you ambush anyone who got too close."/>
<entry name="StunnedFlavor" value="All kinds of ways to freeze up on the battlefield—sometimes it's your brain that locks up, sometimes some Voice-fueled bullshit holds your body in place. Reason doesn't matter though. Whatever's made you freeze, you just get to sit there while the world passes by and the wolves tear you apart."/>
<entry name="SummonFlavor" value="Short-term assets put a ticking clock on your battle plans. Whether deploying Drones or Deformities, we needed to time our attack just right to maximize our firepower. Send them out too soon, and you've already lost the fight."/>
<entry name="SwarmHavocFlavor" value="Sure it made a satisfying “crunch” sound when you took a Shredder out of the sky, but it wouldn't give you a moment's peace. Their blades cut closer and closer the more of them you knocked down. I guess with fewer siblings to bounce off of, they could focus on tearing us apart limb by limb…"/>
<entry name="TacticalArcheologyFlavor" value="A smuggler linked to The Concordat rolled up one day with an “exclusive deal.” Special access to top-tier corpo tech the traders had kept squirreled away. Had to be a catch. Why now? “Humans, the Voice, ZEPHON… only one of them will survive this war,” he said, picking something (meat?) out of his teeth. “We're all-in on humanity. Now we know you are too.”"/>
<entry name="TacticalVisorFlavor" value="Ishim Enforcers were the first cyborgs we created with access to networked intelligence. Our techs cooked up visors that could triangulate enemy positions by pulling data from different Enforcers together. Only problem was, you needed your troops to be close to each other for reliable targeting metrics."/>
<entry name="TalesOfTheHuntFlavor" value="Warlord and I got drunk on the regular, talked bullshit. In the back of his shitty bar, I mumbled something about “Every battle's got its own story”. His response… “Power in that. Makes legends out of mortal men,” he purred. “Power that can win a war.”"/>
<entry name="TemporalDistensionFlavor" value="The best AI-built infantry were small enough to mess with their singularity cores’ event horizons. If a grunt got close, they'd look up and see the sun rocketing across the sky. Like an old time-lapse shot. Or like it was dragged along by chariots."/>
<entry name="TenderMinistrationsFlavor" value="If one of her children gathered near their comrades, her words seemed clearer and more comforting. Their spirit stirred, and the sight of wounds stitching themself up didn't seem the slightest bit odd."/>
<entry name="ThereIsHopeUpgrade2Flavor" value="Everyone was ordered to scratch the name down of someone they loved on a piece of tape. We put that tape on gear we'd grab in the middle of a firefight—magazines, medkits, repair pods, armor, you name it. You'd pick it up, see the name. Remember how much that person meant to you. Nothing could stop you when you were fighting for someone you loved."/>
<entry name="TitanFlavor" value="“Titan” was just a nickname for our largest machines and creatures, but there was something… awfully appropriate about it. Before the Gods, there were Titans. And now here at the end, we have rebirthed their kind and unleashed them out into the world. Giants once walked the Earth—now some of them soared over it."/>
<entry name="TitanMeleeFlavor" value="Keep far, far away from any Titan unless you want to be crushed under a hunk of putrid flesh or rusted metal. However far you think you need to be, go even further."/>
<entry name="ToxicSpearheadFlavor" value="Dragoons would drag their spears through the vile waste the Abkluth left behind after defecating. The tips of their weapons would then be coated in some of the most vile and dangerous substances ever exposed to human skin."/>
<entry name="TransportFlavor" value="The Engineers had a secret. Every troop transport was built to treat people like cargo. “If they feel too safe, they won’t want to leave,” was the line I heard. We packed soldiers together like bodies in a mass grave. All anyone ever wanted to do was get the hell away from these things."/>
<entry name="TransuraniumUpgradeFlavor" value="Enemy artillery leveled our city. Only thing left standing was the… uh, “Transuranium Stabilizer”. A rookie on sensor duty caught the increased power in the building and called it in. Our engineers cooked up a way to capture the energy before it flash-fried us all."/>
<entry name="TrappedFlavor" value="The Emulated Mind's consciousness was bound to a pre-war supercomputer hooked up to a geothermal vent. She was limited by this singular hardware, but also by her desire to be human and individual—not disperse herself across a hundred systems. Her followers built a single city around her fragile frame, and she used it to place a thousand walls between herself and the outside world."/>
<entry name="TrochantersFlavor" value="I think I figured it out… the humans who gave it all up for this “Throkos,” they thought they were transforming, like the rest. But they were just hosts. Incubation sacs for a new kind of life form, something halfway between man and insect, that became faster and deadlier as the poison spread throughout their bodies."/>
<entry name="TwistedMotherAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="“In the old world, prisoners freed from labor camps sometimes returned to live there,” the old man said. “They craved the walls that held them captive.” We were watching the Twisted Mother's people cheerfully walk into the maw of a Sealed Hermitage. Both of us, tense. Both thinking about what we’d been through before she set us free."/>
<entry name="UndersuppliedFlavor" value="The war wasn't just won with bullets. We'd regularly run up against battalions triple the size of our entire militia. You won those battles by diving into their back line and gutting their supply operations. Then we held out until their guts ran empty and their ammo ran dry. An “unstoppable force” brought down by old-fashioned “supply and demand.”"/>
<entry name="UndyingFlavor" value="Poor Fallen Soldier. If you cut him, he would bleed—but his flesh would be restored minutes after you sliced it from his skin. A few fanatics in his ranks were convinced his flesh would have healing properties, and to his greatest horror… they were right. Carrying a piece of his body around would share some of the gift that had brought him back from the grave. Soon all of his people—soldiers, pilots, mechanics—had a piece of him around their necks. A pulsing, still-warm, piece of flesh."/>
<entry name="UnleashedFlavor" value="Plenty of creatures in the wasteland will let you keep the peace but if you start a fight with them you damn well be ready to end it. Nothing that survived the war did so by half-measures. Monsters out there will gladly defend their home by breaking into yours."/>
<entry name="UntoldProphetAffinityUpgrade2Flavor" value="Patrol duty sometimes took me around the Sealed Hermitage. The Prophet needed their faith to flex his power on the battlefield. Fucking weird. Early years they'd be screaming to all the Voice gods. Never the Great Speaker. By the end that was the only name they'd cry out. And they sounded happy while doing it."/>
<entry name="UntoldProphetAffinityUpgradeFlavor" value="Untold Prophet always talked about having the ear of “The Speaker”—maybe it was this Cr'la demon the Disciples crooned about? Ordered us to raise shrines with specific markings for them. Freaky shit. They'd walk up and perfectly fold their bodies into the stone, making a deep, rumbling sound that stayed with me until I closed my eyes at night. If I closed my eyes that night…"/>
<entry name="UntrustworthyFlavor" value="All the great leaders expected they'd be stabbed in the back. Even the supposedly “Honorable” Aristocrat would shrug and say it was “part of the game of war.” But they all still took betrayal so personally. Guess if you have an ego big enough to think you can lead humanity, you feel a bit entitled to humiliate anyone who makes you look like a gullible mark."/>
<entry name="VoiceInfantryUpgradeFlavor" value="The Voice craved loyal followers, and knew that faith wavered as the enemy neared the gates. It found itself new acolytes—preachers who spoke of a disciple named Nihilus. They took up ranks in the Midnight Chorus, and their sonorous chants reached the ears of every soldier surrounding the city; a reminder that the Voice—and its blessings—would be there when needed."/>
<entry name="VoiceVehiclesUpgradeFlavor" value="Death didn't seem to be enough for the Voice. When something died, humans gestating in the Voice’s isolation… quickened. Drew sustenance from the death, somehow. They would emerge sooner from their seclusion, failed in their ascension or not."/>
<entry name="VoidDrifterFlavor" value="Our strongest weapons should have blown those Phenaris-worshiping freaks into bits. But they’d just step… somewhere. Sideways, out of existence itself? Then they'd… ugh. With the sound of a satisfied lover, they’d fade back in, and keep stalking you through the night. Even the Hunters, those boney serpent creeps, made that goddamn sound."/>
<entry name="WeakenedFlavor" value="Out of ammo. Drained. Outnumbered. But my troops wouldn't get home unless I took up a blade and cleared a path to escape. I failed. I was exhausted and my blade bounced off flesh and metal with every swing. Couldn't hurt any of them. I was just an old man who should have been left cowering with the civilians…"/>
<entry name="WeWhoAreAboutToDieFlavor" value="The Warlord's people didn't follow him for safety, they followed him for action. Win or lose, they wanted to see death. Otherwise restless fighters would taunt each other and pick fights throughout the camp. We kept them in line but if you walked the grounds at night then you'd see eyes glowing at you from the tents… deranged men and women wondering if you'll expose yourself for a quick kill."/>
<entry name="WildlifeFlavor" value="We once had an Abkluth contained in a prototype specimen container at a field outpost. It was pacing the confined space, slamming itself into the walls at random intervals. I thought it was trying to escape—until a pack of Abkluth swarmed our camp, devouring a group of helpless techs. It had been &lt;i&gt;signaling&lt;/i&gt; to its pack. We soundproofed the containers after that."/>
<entry name="XenogenesisFlavor" value="Cultists who grew into Ioks spent a few more days in the Paean to the Dawn? After completing the conversion, their task wasn't done. They had the power to birth more Ioks just by sitting and feeding on bodies. The new ones grew in the boils on their backs, exploding to live in a spray of pus and gore. Then that one birthed another. And another. And another…"/>
<entry name="ZephonAdvancementFlavor" value="It was all just an equation for ZEPHON. Reavers and Acrin had to scrap, steal, and fight like hell to keep their edge, but that machine was always plotting its way toward the end. Its machines' power just ticked, ticked, ticked upward… carefully calculated to match our pace. It never ran ahead. Just watched. Followed. And observed."/>
<entry name="ZephonStandingFlavor" value="It was almost an afterthought. During one communication with ZEPHON, a general off-handedly joked about exchanging rights for AI for a small army's worth of Chips. “That would be acceptable,” it replied. No one knew what to do with that. Was ZEPHON thinking ahead, for after the war? Or… no. Certainly not. There couldn't have been other AI among us… right?"/>
