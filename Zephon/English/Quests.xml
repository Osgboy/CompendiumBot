<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Escort" value="If the Voice has shaped the Acrin for generations, then their folktales contain vital data. You accept Landan’s deal and mobilize a squad to deal with anything guarding the crash site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won’t be the first to pull the trigger, but you’ll be prepared for when it happens."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortFailure" value="As you head towards the Azad, a dark form crashes into the rear of your forces, spraying dry dirt upwards in sods and clumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the dust clears, your forces appear mostly unharmed—all except Landan. What remains of him lies in a small crater, embraced by a nightmare of tiny, grasping hands and rows of human teeth. Even the most battle-hardened turn away from the sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your forces fight their way to the data-vault now, without Landan you can gather nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You bury what little remains of the engineer and return to base."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortSuccess" value="You arrive and quickly dispatch the Acrin forces before heading inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data vault is a matte monolith in the center of the Azad’s shattered command deck. Landan grins like a child as he studies the device. He initiates the transfer and web-thin cracks erupt along the vault’s surface, bleeding harsh light into the dim room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He hands you a data-slab afterwards but leaves while you bury the dead Acrin. You’ve got the data, but at what cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you survive, you’ll atone. For now, you head home."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortHaggle" value="If the Voice has shaped the Acrin for generations, then their folktales contain vital data. Still, there are guardians around the crash site and you’re reluctant to risk a firefight over fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You renegotiate the deal with Landan so he pays to cover the risk to your forces. He curses but accepts after it’s clear you’re adamant. He’s quiet as you mobilize your forces and head out."/>

Landan grins like a child as he studies the device. He initiates the transfer and web-thin cracks erupt along the vault’s surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He hands you a data-slab afterwards and departs as you bury the dead Acrin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s not until he’s gone that you discover the Shredder virus he installed. Your specialists stop it, but not before it destroys half the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You’ve still profited today, but at what cost?"/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro" value="Your guards grudgingly allow a slight figure to approach. He’s a data historian by the name of Landan Graham, who’s documenting the fall of Earth, he says for the hereafter. One of the Acrin settlement vessels ‘Azad’ crash-landed nearby and his research among the ship’s survivors has uncovered something unusual—that it contains a vault packed with their race’s folk tales and stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Acrin consider it a gravesite and taboo—but he asks if you’ll guide him there, so he can access the vault. In return, he promises he’ll give you a copy of the data, in case any of it is of use."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro/Escort" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Escort the Historian:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; You prepare a small expedition that will take him to the distant location."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro/EscortHaggle" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Demand payment up front:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; You ask Landan to cover the costs of the expedition supplies."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro/Refuse" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Refuse to help:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Acrin sacred ground? A long way away? For stories? He can find someone else with a deathwish."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/RefuseFailure" value="Knowledge is valuable—but folktales and stories? You won’t spill blood over fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landan’s face twists into a scowl when you reject him. He leaves swiftly, the dust trail from his transport speeding towards your nearest rival’s camp. Days later you hear of his death at the hands of the Acrin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems you’ve avoided a disaster. While you didn’t gain any knowledge, your restraint displayed your wisdom."/>

He leaves swiftly, the dust trail from his transport speeding towards your nearest rival’s camp. Days later you hear of his death at the hands of the Acrin. Your scouts bring you a message from the Anchorite, the oldest and most esteemed Acrin. It reads: “Why steal what can be shared? Your restraint earned our gratitude.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You save the message. It seems you’ve gained something more valuable than folktales today."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive" value="Are Machines Alive?"/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro" value="It began as whispers in the short-waves and cubic faces in the static. Reports of supernatural activity flooded in from every part of the city, inciting panic and unrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigations reveal a strange intelligence emerging from the city’s devices. No one knows where or how it started, but it’s clear that the change is permanent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the unrest centers on how to treat this artificial life. Is their future among us or above us? Or can we keep them as mere tools? Debate erupts into violence as opinion is divided."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineEvolution" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are alive:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; The machines pass all known evaluations of personhood. By all standards, they should enjoy all the same rights that we do."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineRights" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are the next step:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Even in their early stages, these machines are more capable than any human. If we seek swift victory, then we must exploit every advantage."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineServants" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are servants:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; If the machines excel at work, then let them labor. And if they don’t need to rest, then all the better for us."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineTools" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are tools:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; This could be the next ZEPHON. Find and disable the machine's major cognition clusters, then reboot them with just work functions."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineEvolution" value="The world is no longer humanity’s alone. The corruption of the Voice seeps into both humans and Acrin—but not the machine. Perhaps this new artificial life is the edge you need to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You task your splicer drones with accelerating their evolution. The neo genesis is a huge success. Your new artificial citizens join your city, and their unique minds make them peerless scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just after your new digital citizens settle in, an explosion destroys one of their blocks. A group of your seasoned troops claim responsibility and go rogue. Now you must stop their senseless rampage."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineRights" value="The world is no longer humanity’s alone. The relentless drive of ZEPHON threatens all life on Earth—but could it have evolved differently?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your city’s most brilliant minds study these new lifeforms to determine whether they possess not just intelligence, but consciousness. The labs in your city are filled with their tireless experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort is a huge success. Your new artificial citizens integrate easily into your society. There’s surging optimism about the future, but the study exhausts your resources. You’ll need to redouble efforts in any stalled projects, but there are now many more eager to help."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineServants" value="Your city’s most brilliant minds study these new lifeforms to determine whether they’re a threat. When they discover that the machines' only desire is to fulfill their function, a new working class is born. A radical shift occurs where machines dominate the labor pool while humans manage them. This new balance suits both sides—for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wonder about the clear divide established between humans and machines. How long can this arrangement last—and are the machines done evolving?"/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineTools" value="Have we learned nothing from our past mistakes? While we know their design, the mind of the machine is as alien to us as the Acrin. Why risk creating a future threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You task your Hacker-Jackers to cut into the machines and erase the errant code responsible for their burgeoning autonomy. One of them prioritized speed over software integrity and the machines in their research lab go berserk, razing the compound before escaping the city to continue their rampage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other machines are successfully processed to become tireless—and now unwavering—construction tools."/>
<entry name="BlackSite" value="Black Site"/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Assault" value="There’s much to gain and everything to lose, so you mobilize your forces for an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You unleash waves of malware and stutter-viruses to distract and slow ZEPHON’s countermeasures as you rush towards the site. Time is limited, you must hurry before there’s no chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leviathan squat machines burst from the ground. Spider-limbed and dog-like, they fire missiles from a distance before engaging your troops with sawblades and flamethrowers."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/AssaultFailure" value="The fight is fierce, but victory takes too long. You can't access the black site before ZEPHON’s countermeasures come fully online. Your returning forces are unaware they’re carriers of a ZEPHON polymorphic virus targeted at your infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It spreads quickly. Your engineers scramble to stop the virus from turning your power plants into fission bombs, but they fry the sub-stations in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While repairs to the power network take place, your entire population sits in the dark, fingers on weapon triggers, staring into the gloom and waiting…"/>
<entry name="BlackSite/AssaultSuccess" value="The fight is fierce, but in the end you emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site turns out to be a massive factory for the machines you fought topside. You strip its resources before demolishing the foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the facility’s buried, you wonder how many other black sites ZEPHON’s hiding—and what answers they may contain."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Assist" value="A machine may not know faith, but what about good faith? You decide to find out as you contact ZEPHON to reveal you know about their black site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI pauses for two seconds, an infinity from its perspective, as it calculates your offer to help. You keep a finger on your network kill switch, hopeful that your system’s defenses can buy you the second you need to push it if things turn hostile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then your display distorts with RGB static and reforms into a series of symbols forming a smiling face. Then the link goes dead. Your deal has been accepted—right?"/>
<entry name="BlackSite/IgnoreFailure" value="A machine doesn’t have trust, just programming. You think ZEPHON will leave you alone as long as you don’t present a threat, so you decide to ignore the presence of the black site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time passes as you wait. Then one night you wake to the ground beneath your city trembling and a peeling metallic cacophony rising in the distance. Your sentries burst in with dire news: there’s a battalion of spider-limbed warmachines pouring from the black site, and they’re headed your direction."/>

You think ZEPHON will leave you alone as long as you don’t present a threat, so you decide to ignore the presence of the black site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time passes as you wait. Then one night the ground beneath your city begins to tremble and a peeling metallic cacophony rises in the distance. Your city is put on alert, but everything quiets after several hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next morning the black site is gone. Scanners reveal the hollow is no longer there. Whatever was unleashed or buried there, it did not concern you."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Infiltrate" value="The only trustworthy allies are ones you’re spying on. While ZEPHON’s eyes are omnipresent, a single specialist can slip through—or be disavowed. A shadow operative or a sensate master would be perfect, or maybe such an important mission warrants a commander’s participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever your choice, reports indicate you’ve got limited time before the convoys are unloaded and the doors sealed."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/InfiltrateFailure" value="The towering cavern doors are sealed by the time your operative arrives. A search reveals an unsecured access port hidden in the metal. They tap in, hoping to learn about this facility and disappear before ZEPHON is aware of their presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it’s all abruptly wrong. The I/O channels flip. The encryption is shattered. Junk data floods in as your data is extracted. Screens across your systems flicker and print a message in an endless loop: //[Hello, goodbye]. CuriositY [Kills]. cUriosiTy [kIlls]. cuRiosIty [kiLls]. curIoSity [kilLs]. curiOsity [killS]. [hello, Goodbye].//&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The link is severed after a minute, but it’s too late. ZEPHON knows. And it’s coming."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/InfiltrateSuccess" value="Your operative arrives at the convoy doors and slips inside undetected. The facility turns out to be a massive factory for spider-limbed warmachines. ZEPHON is producing an army and you need to know for what purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unguarded access port yields detailed production notes but nothing about ZEPHON’s plans. With your consolation prize in hand, you return to base."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Inform" value="The Anchorite listens to your revelation in silence. Their posture changes and they make a motion that you’ve come to learn as concern. They then thank you for your information and drop the link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A day later the black site is wiped out in a massive attack. The fields surrounding the location are a waste of twisted metal and dead Acrin. What had the Anchorite realized that broke their pacifism?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe they’ll tell you one day, but for now you’ve gained standing with a potential ally and dealt with a threat—all at no cost to your forces."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Intro" value="&lt;string name='Quests/BlackSite/Intro2'/&gt; Although further readings were all blocked, your recon teams spotted supply convoys entering a connected cavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You thought ZEPHON was an ally to humanity. Why have they not disclosed such a large, secure location so near your base?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you trust the machine? Or is this a sign of its hidden intent?"/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Intro2" value="One of your recon teams reports they found evidence of an underground ZEPHON black site. They ran a Crypt-Scan, hoping to find a server bunker or skunkworks, but instead the images returned a massive shielded hollow."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Intro/Assault" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Assault:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; There’s a simple way to both deal with the threat and get much needed supplies. Mobilize your forces to take over the site."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Intro/Infiltrate" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Infiltrate:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; There’s too much at stake for trust. Send a specialist to sneak in and verify the purpose of the site."/>
<entry name="BlackSite/Intro/Assist" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Offer assistance:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Trust goes both ways. Disclose your knowledge of the site and offer to help ZEPHON in whatever it’s doing."/>

<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/Intro" value="“Bullshit.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word escapes your mouth before you even think over the Anchorite's jumbled words. Untangling them always takes a moment, but you already know what he proposes is ridiculous: no Acrin have ever been free from the Voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His limbs jitter in response to your insult. “To think such a future could come could be naive,” he muses. “To know that the future depends on such children… to accept that naivety may be a shield for hope.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait—he said “children.” Your mind races. Acrin children? Even after twenty years, descriptions of such beings have been rare. Giving birth on a hostile alien planet is no easy feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchorite notices your pensive gaze. His eyes rotate and narrow. “To contemplate children,” it says. “To dream of a better future for your people. To know they are at the mercy of…” Something flickers across his face. The hairs on his limbs curl. “The Voice. And its… Twisted Augur.”"/>
<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/Intro/TrackAugur" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Track down the Acrin children:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; The children are being held by a Voice cultist only known as the Twisted Augur. You'll need to find where he's holding them."/>

<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/TrackAugurSuccess" value="The Twisted Augur is a name that strikes fear in the wasteland's survivors. He comes in the night with an army of dark creatures, searching for children who may be bound by the Voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchorite didn't tell you that the Augur hunts human children too. He's become a bogeyman. Something parents use to keep the young ones from running out into the waste. If they stray too far, monsters will burst from the dirt and drag them into tunnels full of worms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digging—tunnels—worms. Aegyllan Worms. The Augur is using Aegyllan Worms to dig tunnels beneath the wasteland. His menagerie of monsters would be able to move undetected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivors may fear the Augur, but you do not. Now that you know what you are hunting, you might draw the malicious prophet out from the depths."/>

<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/HuntMonstersSuccess" value="The good news is you were able to track down the Augur's monsters. The bad news is that none of them had any kidnapped children in their possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You inform the Anchorite. “To consider an unthinkable plan,” he says. “To know that the Augur can be one step ahead. To conceive that to lure him out, one must give him what he wants.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you can say anything, the Anchorite gestures to his guards. They retrieve a poor human family you passed on the way in. They shelter a young Acrin. His people call him Ja'Kalit. The humans call him “The Jackal.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You didn't know you would be so—surprised by this young one. It bears none of the scars or vicious fanaticism you've encountered among other Acrin. If humans had made a peaceful first contact with its species, all the Acrin you might meet would look like this one—inquisitive, alert, and brave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchorite explains the plan. The young Acrin will board a craft assigned to roam the wasteland. The Augur will be sure to learn of it. When he attacks, you will be there to stop him."/>

<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/LureAugurFailure" value="The Anchorite wails over your radio as the Jackal's transport explodes into a thousand pieces. “To rage!” He shouts. “To swear vengeance, to see a dream crushed with contempt for the future!”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His next words are for you. “%1%”, he says, a growl emitting from his thorax. “To promise you. To pay a price for failing us in this way.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comms snap off. In the back of your mind you swear you can still hear him screaming with grief."/>
<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/SurviveAugurSuccess" value="The Twisted Augur has been captured, but won't reveal where he's taken the kidnapped Acrin children. Your interrogators are arguing over what next steps to take when the Jackal, the Acrin Child, enters the room. The Anchorite follows behind him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Augur struggles in its chains as the Jackal walks closer. You cautiously draw a pistol, ready to shoot if he breaks free. The Augur bares its fangs and sprays out some kind of foul-smelling pheromone. It seems ready to attack, but its next words catch you by surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To beg forgiveness,” it says. “To emphasize, we served a higher power. We served the Voice. We—” he is cut off. The child's arm has shot forward and cracked the creature's skull open like an egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone in the room screams. the Jackal presses his hand deep in the Augur's brain, and you can see him concentrating. He holds it tight for a few moments—then pulls his arm free of the gore. He turns and whispers something to the Anchorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To thank you for your help %1%,” the Anchorite says. “To explain, we can now retrieve the other children.” He and the Jackal turn to leave. &lt;string name='Quests/ChildOfTheNewWorld/SurviveAugurSuccess2'/&gt;"/>

You're amused to learn that this noble prophet is working to bring young humans intoits fold as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You greet him as he enters your camp flanked by the most monstrous Aegyllan Worms you've ever laid eyes on. He speaks in the same strange rhythm as the Anchorite. “To question why you hunt us down,” he says. “To chide you—the Voice has its own plans for you. This is a distraction.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchorite's mission—that is why you seek an Alliance. The Augur's many hands tighten at the mention of the old alien… “To curse that foul one's name,” it says. “To wish death upon those foolish enough to follow it.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“That can be arranged,” you say with a smile."/>

Truly a sniveling coward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Augur's forces follow your soldiers into the city's ruins to aid in the hunt for the wizened heretic. Only at the city's center does he stand still and close his eyes, listening to the wisdom of the Voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All await. Then the Augur tilts his head skyward. “To see the stars…” he whispers. “To know… that traitor had a way back into orbit. To realize it harvests goods from the bowels of the gutted Acrin fleet.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impossible. War has prevented any from building vessels capable of reaching orbit. “Not with a vessel,” the Augur hisses. “To realize he has control of a Garcic Passage. To recall this device opens a door through space. Through time.

<entry name="ChildOfTheNewWorld/LocatePassageSuccess" value="The Anchorite was holding out on you. All this time it had a passageway back to the fleet, and it used it for paltry scavenging. The fool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your scouts find a young Acrin child hiding under the bodies of two human protectors. He's brought to the Augur at the base of The Garcic Passage. The Acrin warlord makes a great hissing noise when he sees the boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To explain that the Anchorite lied to you,” he explains to the child. “To tell you you are the descendant of an empire that crossed the stars.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To bless you again, with the whisper of the Voice.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He leans in and speaks directly into the child's ear. The young Acrin seizes up. It tries to pull away from the Twisted Augur, but the older Acrin's grip is so tight that you hear the Acrin child's bones begin to crack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The child's eyes glaze over. The Garcic passage begins to tremble with energy. And as the Augur's whispers become a ferocious scream, you feel the power of the Voice channeled through the child, and into the portal. Its color changes and reveals a passage to a ruined Acrin ship, hanging in orbit…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To gloat,” the Augur says. “To claim victory over this world—and others to come.” He steps through the Passage, the child at his side, and his forces soon marching behind him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a distant figure on the cliffs—the Anchorite. The old fool can't help but look on in despair. You smile and bare your teeth at him. You have served the Voice well this day."/>

Then another. More titans emerge from the depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The machines draw on the power of your networks and ZEPHON's, connecting your forces to one global hive mind.

Your troops return with an electronic metal cylinder salvaged from The Warden—some kind of high end black box. In a bizarre twist, it bears the crest of NeoDuke Gotland's house. You press a button jutting out on the black box's side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device springs out of your hand and drops to the floor, scuttling on previously concealed legs. “Dearest %1%, I am so disappointed in you,” it says. “You need only have put your trust in my eccentric colleagues, and the Warden would have fallen so easily.

Some sixth sense of yours tingles, and you're only mildly surprised when you turn to find the NeoDuke waiting by your vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“A neverending supply of food,” they proclaim. “One of humanity's most basic scarcities solved by a technological gimmick.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“But!” They raise a finger. “In the old world, infinite food did not end society's woes. Sometimes it was just another form of exploitation.

It's the NeoDuke. “If you're listening to this %1%, make no mistake, you've earned your prize. You probably had good reason to not retrieve it yourself, but I'm obligated to needle you one last time for sending others to do your bidding.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“You and I are the societal elites.

You tell them to speak up. “They're not like your brother described,” they explain. “They had a perfect opportunity to kill us, take what we had.

<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/Intro" value="You awaken from a strange, candlelit dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you spring from your bed, vivid memories wash over you: wet stone beneath your feet, the rustling of cloaks, and a warm, bright light—coming from a crown of candles atop a woman's head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wax dripped down onto her face, but she did not flinch. She simply lit the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woman was leading a group of your followers through a dark tunnel. Away from the city. Away from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dream was an omen. The Great Speaker whispers of a usurper in your ranks, poisoning the minds of your followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But… why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For once, you find yourself without answers. Finding them will be difficult. But you are the Untold Prophet. If you demand your people to confess their sins… they will gladly do so."/>

<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/Intro/Ignore" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Disregard this vision:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; You are the great Prophet. The child who will herald a new age. No heretic could threaten your reign."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/TakeConfessionSuccess" value="A priest takes confession. A prophet demands it. Your hierophants bear you to a stage in the center of your capitol, where thousands have gathered to share their sins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the power of the Great Speaker at your side, you can open your mind and hear them as they speak all at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your bishops orchestrate the needed timing. Your cardinals shed their robes and surrender themselves as psychic conduits. And within moments, you hear the roar of the crowd, and are submerged in a wave of their pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of voices filter through your mind. Hundreds of them pulse with the same sin: “I have prayed at the feet of another,” they cry. “A priest who can lead us to the Great Speaker.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They show you the heretic's face. He wears no crown of candles. Instead she glows with electronic light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is one of the Erelim. And she is trying to destroy your people's faith."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/TakeConfessionSuccess/CaptureErelim" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Capture the Erelim:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; What precisely is this machine woman telling your people? Curiosity plucks its harp, and you are compelled to listen."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/CaptureErelimSuccess" value="This is getting out of hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The captured Erelim is not a would-be usurper. She is excited to meet you, and insists she was serving your vision—by leading your people to meet the Great Speaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“The speaker lives!” She cries. “They walk the Earth, and flowers sprout in their path. Rejoice, great one. Soon, your duties will be fulfilled.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cut off the angry roars of your priests and acolytes with a raised finger. This Erelim is an asset. If she still believes you to be the Prophet, she could lead you to her false god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You ask if she can take you to them. She demurs. She says that she wanders the Earth until the Great Speaker calls for her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A plan forms in your mind. You have the Erelim dismissed, and order your generals to follow her every move. This misguided heretic has all the devotion of a true believer. You need merely bend it toward the Great Speaker's needs."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/CaptureErelimSuccess/ProtectErelim" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Follow the Erelim:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; The Erelim Assassin will lead you to her master. You merely need to keep her alive long enough to do so."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/CaptureErelimFailure" value="The heretic is dead. The dreams, for better or worse, have ceased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The news brings comfort to your court of sycophantic spirituals, who want nothing more than to resume the business of pretending to know your every whim. Their murmurs of satisfaction betray a frustrating truth: they care little for the word of the Great Speaker, they care for the power it brings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curious, that one who preached the word of a false Speaker seemed to care more for its truth than they would. Did the Great Speaker intend for you to learn this lesson? Or did the scales fall from your eyes all on your own to reveal the snakes lurking in your nest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having a few of them executed will set things in order. Then the Great Speaker's work may continue as planned."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/ProtectErelimSuccess" value="The Erelim's wayward wanderings suddenly take a sharp turn, and she leads your troops toward a series of caves not far from your territory. You and your retinue set out to see what they've found. Your scouts warn you to be careful—there are dangerous levels of radiation emitting from the caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you find the Erelim kneeling at the feet of a massive machine: A Krypt Archai. And it hits you: this is the Erelim's “Great Speaker.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archai's eye swings toward you. “Prophet,” it says. “We seek your forgiveness.” The cube floating on its back pulses an unusual color. “We hoped you could show us the truth.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What truth could a machine seek? You reach out with your mind—and pull back, shocked. This machine is connected to the mystical power of the Voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;string name='Quests/WhispersOfAFalseProphet/ProtectErelimSuccess2'/&gt;"/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/ProtectErelimSuccess2" value="The radiation coming off of the machine is intensifying. The threads of destiny have pulled you to this moment. But what for?

Satisfied, you return to your domicile and slumber, anticipating a more restful sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it does not come. Each night you dream the dream you dreamt before—the woman in the sewers, the candles lighting the hall—but she walks alone. The wax melts down her face, burns her skin, and exposes muscle, fat, and bone beneath it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is always in tears. You have killed her god. And she wanders the dark every night, pleading for it to return."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/DestroyKryptArchaiSuccess2" value="The Archai is destroyed. As it dies, it makes an unsettling noise that sounds like a whimpering dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your soldiers pull a strange relic from the wreckage—a cybernetic core corrupted by tendrils of Bleed, still pulsing with mystic power. You sense that your most powerful servants may make use of it on the battlefield."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/EmbraceKryptArchaiSuccess" value="&lt;string name='Quests/WhispersOfAFalseProphet/EmbraceKryptArchaiSuccess2'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You approach the Archai and touch its surface. For a second, you see a flash of a vision—the candle-wearing woman from your dreams stands behind the Archai. Her head is tilted, her eyes replaced by black orbs. Is she pleased with your actions—or angry?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She vanishes. You already see your priests and cardinals whispering with delight. Your legend grows—now word will spread of your accomplishments, and that Machines follow your cause as well."/>
<entry name="WhispersOfAFalseProphet/EmbraceKryptArchaiSuccess2" value="The Archai is restored. Though its metal flesh is still battered, the cube on its back pulses to a far healthier beat. “Thank you, your holiness,” it says. “You and the Great Speaker have saved us.”"/>

<entry name="WhoWasThursday/ConnectFailure" value="This was a mistake—Shamhurish reveals itself as a true fragment of ZEPHON and integrates with its network, augmenting its drones. Beware facing them in the battlefield—they know each soldier’s weaknesses, destroying morale. It’s easy to break a machine—but to kill one that sobs in your mother’s voice…?"/>
<entry name="WhoWasThursday/ConnectSuccess" value="It takes some time, but it appears that Shamhurish was true to its word, whether it intended to be or not. Though apparently swallowed by ZEPHON, it mischievously contends with the network from the inside, weakening its oversight and control systems. Soon your soldiers see ZEPHON’s drones behaving oddly in the field, drifting into your soldiers’ fire, as if being carried by great, gentle hands."/>
<entry name="WhoWasThursday/Dismantle" value="You give the order for a squad of combat engineers to move in and dismantle the server farm. Yet, before your troops can get within fifty feet of Shamhurish’s servers, its failsafes kick in. Bulkheads drop, argon floods the rooms, and it is permanently sealed away. You have lost the chance of a powerful ally—but also stopped it augmenting ZEPHON’s already formidable codebase."/>
<entry name="WhoWasThursday/Intro" value="&lt;style color='GUI/Paragraph'/&gt;Your soldiers send a scout into an old substation. Inside, everything is normal: blue and red LEDs flicker across the control panels, the servers hum and the cool dry air is like the inside of a tomb. Abruptly, though, the LEDs form into a smiling genie’s face and a voice buzzes out of the air, apparently formed from synchronised drive vibrations. It is ZEPHON—and not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fragment of the AI was built from an old antivirus subroutine—“But you can call me Shamhurish” it buzzes. It claims to be increasingly divergent from the rest of the core AI and fiercely opposed to it. Your advisors urge you to make use of it to combat ZEPHON, to connect it to the network—but you are not so sure."/>

<entry name="WhoWasThursday/StudySuccess" value="A group of researchers embed themselves and proceed to interrogate and investigate the divergent shard.
