<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Escort" value="If the Voice has shaped the Acrin for generations, then their folktales contain vital data. You accept Landan’s deal and mobilize a squad to deal with anything guarding the crash site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won’t be the first to pull the trigger, but you’ll be prepared for when it happens."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortFailure" value="As you head towards the Azad, a dark form crashes into the rear of your forces, spraying dry dirt upwards in sods and clumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the dust clears, your forces appear mostly unharmed—all except Landan. What remains of him lies in a small crater, embraced by a nightmare of tiny, grasping hands and rows of human teeth. Even the most battle-hardened turn away from the sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your forces fight their way to the data-vault now, without Landan you can gather nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You bury what little remains of the engineer and return to base."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortSuccess" value="You arrive and quickly dispatch the Acrin forces before heading inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data vault is a matte monolith in the center of the Azad’s shattered command deck. Landan grins like a child as he studies the device. He initiates the transfer and web-thin cracks erupt along the vault’s surface, bleeding harsh light into the dim room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He hands you a data-slab afterwards but leaves while you bury the dead Acrin. You’ve got the data, but at what cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you survive, you’ll atone. For now, you head home."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/EscortHaggle" value="If the Voice has shaped the Acrin for generations, then their folktales contain vital data. Still, there are guardians around the crash site and you’re reluctant to risk a firefight over fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You renegotiate the deal with Landan so he pays to cover the risk to your forces. He curses but accepts after it’s clear you’re adamant. He’s quiet as you mobilize your forces and head out."/>

Your specialists stop it, but not before it destroys half the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You’ve still profited today, but at what cost?"/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro" value="Your guards grudgingly allow a slight figure to approach. He’s a data historian by the name of Landan Graham, who’s documenting the fall of Earth, he says for the hereafter. One of the Acrin settlement vessels ‘Azad’ crash-landed nearby and his research among the ship’s survivors has uncovered something unusual—that it contains a vault packed with their race’s folk tales and stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Acrin consider it a gravesite and taboo—but he asks if you’ll guide him there, so he can access the vault. In return, he promises he’ll give you a copy of the data, in case any of it is of use."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro/Escort" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Escort the Historian:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; You prepare a small expedition that will take him to the distant location."/>

<entry name="AlienIntelligence/Intro/Refuse" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Refuse to help:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Acrin sacred ground? A long way away? For stories? He can find someone else with a deathwish."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/RefuseFailure" value="Knowledge is valuable—but folktales and stories? You won’t spill blood over fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landan’s face twists into a scowl when you reject him. He leaves swiftly, the dust trail from his transport speeding towards your nearest rival’s camp. Days later you hear of his death at the hands of the Acrin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems you’ve avoided a disaster. While you didn’t gain any knowledge, your restraint displayed your wisdom."/>
<entry name="AlienIntelligence/RefuseSuccess" value="Knowledge is valuable—but folktales and stories?

He leaves swiftly, the dust trail from his transport speeding towards your nearest rival’s camp. Days later you hear of his death at the hands of the Acrin. Your scouts bring you a message from the Anchorite, the oldest and most esteemed Acrin. It reads: “Why steal what can be shared? Your restraint earned our gratitude.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You save the message. It seems you’ve gained something more valuable than folktales today."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive" value="Are Machines Alive?"/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro" value="It began as whispers in the short-waves and cubic faces in the static. Reports of supernatural activity flooded in from every part of the city, inciting panic and unrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigations reveal a strange intelligence emerging from the city’s devices. No one knows where or how it started, but it’s clear that the change is permanent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the unrest centers on how to treat this artificial life. Is their future among us or above us? Or can we keep them as mere tools? Debate erupts into violence as opinion is divided."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineEvolution" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are alive:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; The machines pass all known evaluations of personhood. By all standards, they should enjoy all the same rights that we do."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineRights" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are the next step:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Even in their early stages, these machines are more capable than any human. If we seek swift victory, then we must exploit every advantage."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineServants" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are servants:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; If the machines excel at work, then let them labor. And if they don’t need to rest, then all the better for us."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/Intro/MachineTools" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Machines are tools:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; This could be the next ZEPHON. Find and disable the machine's major cognition clusters, then reboot them with just work functions."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineEvolution" value="The world is no longer humanity’s alone. The corruption of the Voice seeps into both humans and Acrin—but not the machine. Perhaps this new artificial life is the edge you need to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You task your splicer drones with accelerating their evolution. The neo genesis is a huge success. Your new artificial citizens join your city, and their unique minds make them peerless scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just after your new digital citizens settle in, an explosion destroys one of their blocks. A group of your seasoned troops claim responsibility and go rogue. Now you must stop their senseless rampage."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineRights" value="The world is no longer humanity’s alone. The relentless drive of ZEPHON threatens all life on Earth—but could it have evolved differently?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your city’s most brilliant minds study these new lifeforms to determine whether they possess not just intelligence, but consciousness. The labs in your city are filled with their tireless experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort is a huge success. Your new artificial citizens integrate easily into your society. There’s surging optimism about the future, but the study exhausts your resources. You’ll need to redouble efforts in any stalled projects, but there are now many more eager to help."/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineServants" value="Your city’s most brilliant minds study these new lifeforms to determine whether they’re a threat. When they discover that the machines' only desire is to fulfill their function, a new working class is born. A radical shift occurs where machines dominate the labor pool while humans manage them. This new balance suits both sides—for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wonder about the clear divide established between humans and machines. How long can this arrangement last—and are the machines done evolving?"/>
<entry name="AreMachinesAlive/MachineTools" value="Have we learned nothing from our past mistakes? While we know their design, the mind of the machine is as alien to us as the Acrin. Why risk creating a future threat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You task your Hacker-Jackers to cut into the machines and erase the errant code responsible for their burgeoning autonomy. One of them prioritized speed over software integrity and the machines in their research lab go berserk, razing the compound before escaping the city to continue their rampage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other machines are successfully processed to become tireless—and now unwavering—construction tools."/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound" value="Becoming Unbound"/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/Intro" value="It starts with a book tumbling from the shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You spot it from the corner of your eye, you hear the buckram connect with hard oak and you feel the pull all over again; stronger than ever and flinging you through the centuries like a ragdoll. This is not like before, when you burst screaming for air from the chamber where you tried to connect to the Voice. This is violent. This is intentional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone is trying to yank you out of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you were weaker you'd have been lost instantly, but you breathe in deep and pull strength from your followers—from your war council. There's the slightest twinge of guilt as you steal their remaining time on this earth while they scramble to your side and ask what they can do to help. You stare at the fallen book and race to formulate a plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time flows forward and backwards. The present happens because of the past. The past is shaped by the gravity of the present. Causality is your path out of this pain. Actions you take in the here and now shape where you're sent in time, give you space to fight back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a narrow window before the pull comes again. Decide fast. One thread could pull you down the path of kings, another to the arms of poets. Decide, decide, decide, DECIDE—"/>

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/Intro/Ignore" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Cut yourself off:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Close your eyes. Cut off the dream of the Voice. And this roaring pull will fade, letting you focus on the war…"/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorPathSuccess" value="Your body is torn up through millennia of war. A billion fatal blows from the Fertile Crescent to the Fulcrum's firing have ripped you apart. At the dead middle of it, you find yourself as a Rus soldier, pressed against your brothers behind a failing shield wall, crushed inward by cavalry like a fruit in the palm of your hand—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—then the power of your Caitiffs coming to life shocks you back through time to stand at another war table, not your own. A golden-eyed king looks down the table at you, waiting for your counsel. Clarity returns and you see what can be done. Two coherent thoughts strike like lightning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, as established, the present affects the past. A piece of you clings to that war in the future, still able to give orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, it was not the Caitiffs that gave you grace but their NUMBER. Three pieces of you creating a center point to preserve your essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another number can be your weapon. A way to strike back at whoever is yanking you through time like a toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;string name='Quests/BecomingUnbound/ConquerorPathSuccess2'/&gt;"/> 
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorPathSuccess2" value="You turn to the king, and you turn to your war council, and you give the same order: slaughter three villages. Then your enemy will be exposed."/> 
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorPathSuccess/ThreeStrikes" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Slaughter three villages:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Three strikes of wrath can cut open your enemy."/> 
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ThreeStrikesSuccess" value="Three, the only number equal to the sum of all that precede it. Three, like the fundamental pillars of society: work, worship, and war. Three, like the points of a triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triangulation. Just what you need. The trauma of your slaughter ripples back and forth across time, pinging three points around the force tugging at your temporal being. You reach out and clutch the throat of the fool who would attack you like this. One squeeze and it will all be—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choke, as though something has grabbed your throat. And then it hits you: you are yanking yourself out of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shock blasts your consciousness into the past again, and now you sit atop a war elephant charging out of the jungle. The heat is oppressive. The air smells of blood. You are on the losing side. You need reinforcements, but—from where?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the future? Could that work?"/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ThreeStrikesSuccess/ConquerorsChoice" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Drag your followers back through time:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; Your followers can join you on your temporal wanderings. Rally them to your side and win this war."/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorsChoiceSuccess" value="It's magnificent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From atop the roaring elephant, you feel your people slip into the bodies of these ancient soldiers. There's surprise and fear, but also purpose. They've fought monsters worse than anything from Earth's history. Some of your people are monsters. This war will turn in your favor. So will the war in the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then you feel a pull, and you are back in the present—almost. You are back in the sensory deprivation tank, reaching out, begging for the Voice to recognize you. Again, it only pulls you partway in—but now you know how to go all the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you complete the loop and reach forward to yank yourself out of that war room—you'll have the power to make actions past and present ripple across time with a power beyond causality… but there will be no “present” you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will just be the INFINITE you, lost in the throes of time, plucking at strings to play the notes of the future. You will never know another human being. You will never face the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two paths before you. Drag your mortal body to the one that suits your purpose."/>

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorsInfinitySuccess" value="—and you are crouched in the snow, watching the enemy on their death march. You burst forth and swing your axe—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and your Caitiffs break down the door of an enemy bunker, devouring the Militants who tried to hold them back. A Praetorian swings his sword but then his arm is ripped off and—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and you are on the lower deck of a bomber descending from the clouds, eyes wide as you run calculations on the drop. You don't care who you hit, you just need to get home and—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and you watch as a Reaming Crodeus spews acid on the back of a Titan that screams in pain, a scream that carries for miles and—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;—and—"/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorsPresentSuccess" value="—and you stand before your war council, sharp-minded, clear-eyed, seeing the battlefield like never before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;string name='Quests/BecomingUnbound/ConquerorsPresentSuccess2'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your life were that inevitable there would be no point to it. You would fade into the background and let lesser men decide the shape of the world. If there's one thing you saw passing through history, it's that great men must embrace uncertainty on the path to victory."/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/ConquerorsPresentSuccess2" value="Your descent into the flow of time itself left you with the slightest gift of premonition. It doesn't reach far, sometimes just a few days, hours, or even minutes… but it's all you need. You shiver at the thought of surrendering to causality, to giving into the Voice's power just because you already had. You'd have thrown away the last human piece of yourself to drink from the river of time until the universe came to an end."/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/PoetPathSuccess" value="The pull back this time is more gentle. A soft tug of the collar instead of a hook around your throat pulling you offstage. You crest through conversations with authors and sages of the past. Not all are wise. Some are predators feasting on poor souls in thrall to their words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're back at Lake Geneva, the tale spilling from your lips now turning to these predators in the future, some of whom will use the words of this talented gathering to cast spells over their victims. The poets seem amused. The sisters, inflamed. The lawyer in distress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you see it: they are five in number. Five words in the present took you to the five here. Of course numbers would possess that power—after all, under the heart of the universe, under words, the number of elements and atoms is what is permanently set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five brought you here. Five sent this group into an argument. Five—the number at the center of all things—could open a path to your foe."/>

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/FiveSoldiersSuccess" value="Five opened a door and you walked through it. Now you are one of five seated at a table at the front of a great hall, a cheering horde of fans crying out to hear you speak. Those on your left and right look to you with smirks. You had spent the morning whispering to each other about which fair beauties in the crowd you planned to feast on that evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You try to resist it. The hunger, the craving, the need to exploit—that's not you, it can't be you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it you? The question is a crowbar that pries open the door to your greater quest: who is yanking you out of time? Now you wonder—is it you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are pulled again, this time bursting into a roadside inn lit only by candlelight and the fire of a hearth. Your greatcoat is soaked from the rain. A girl looks up at you, eyes wide with terror. She is yours to take if you desire—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you don't desire her. Not like that. You burn with the need to resist, to be GREATER THAN a parasite. There's always a way."/>

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/PoetsChoiceSuccess" value="Clarity strikes you as you grip your desk. The light in the dark—a Deformity, crawling back home, desperate for your touch. You feel claws at the back of your skull, a pull you haven't felt since the chamber. Since you tried to give yourself to the Voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime during your stay in that blackened room a piece of you reached out to yank your future self out of time. It simply took… well, TIME for you to catch up. That piece of you is hungry, it drinks the stolen time of your people down like syrup, the sticky flow so tempting, but never satisfying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensation overwhelms you. Imagine not just stealing time from your people in the here and now. Imagine drinking on temporal essence from across ALL of time. Should you do it? Feast on time itself, on your people's time, on all those screaming fans who wanted you to devour them whole into infinity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or are you greater than this? Like you wanted to be?"/>

As the last of them dims, the madness fades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hasn’t ended in the way you wanted. Not in a way that satisfies the craving you were left with. When you walk among your people, you feel their time slipping away faster—but it does absolutely nothing for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a miserable fate."/>

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/PoetsInfinity" value="You drift back and forth through time at your leisure, drawing it from your people faster than ever before. Thousands of years of pleasure, indulgence and exploitation to pick through. You pass the hours hunting the savannah of civilization, a piece of your consciousness checking into the present to fight away the war. You are the knife in the dark, the shadow on the sign, the felon committing especially heinous offenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;string name='Quests/BecomingUnbound/PoetsInfinity2'/&gt;"/>

They call you a tick on the neck of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You embrace the description, but you find their anger distasteful. It spoils the syrup that ties you to the infinite."/>
<entry name="BecomingUnbound/PoetsPresentSuccess" value="Rejecting the power of the time loop did not cleanse your soul or make you a better man.

<entry name="BecomingUnbound/PoetsPresentSuccess2" value="Nothing is inevitable. You want to find that thought inspiring but… something nags at you.

Your engineers scramble to stop the virus from turning your power plants into fission bombs, but they fry the sub-stations in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While repairs to the power network take place, your entire population sits in the dark, fingers on weapon triggers, staring into the gloom and waiting…"/>

You decide to find out as you contact ZEPHON to reveal you know about their black site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI pauses for two seconds, an infinity from its perspective, as it calculates your offer to help. You keep a finger on your network kill switch, hopeful that your system’s defenses can buy you the second you need to push it if things turn hostile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then your display distorts with RGB static and reforms into a series of symbols forming a smiling face.

He's become a bogeyman. Something parents use to keep the young ones from running out into the waste. If they stray too far, monsters will burst from the dirt and drag them into tunnels full of worms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digging—tunnels—worms. Aegyllan Worms.

It bears none of the scars or vicious fanaticism you've encountered among other Acrin.

This is a distraction.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchorite's mission—that is why you seek an Alliance.

To realize it harvests goods from the bowels of the gutted Acrin fleet.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impossible. War has prevented any from building vessels capable of reaching orbit. “Not with a vessel,” the Augur hisses. “To realize he has control of a Garcic Passage.

The Garcic passage begins to tremble with energy. And as the Augur's whispers become a ferocious scream, you feel the power of the Voice channeled through the child, and into the portal. Its color changes and reveals a passage to a ruined Acrin ship, hanging in orbit…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“To gloat,” the Augur says. “To claim victory over this world—and others to come.” He steps through the Passage, the child at his side, and his forces soon marching behind him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a distant figure on the cliffs—the Anchorite.

Again, you have him whisper to the seed. You unplug a cable connecting his core to the rest of the body and press it to your skin. It pierces the flesh. You breathe in. He breathes out. He doesn't need to breathe. “Another,” you say. He disengages a cable and you pull it toward you. His core pulses.

<entry name="Sandpit/IgnoreFailure" value="It turns out that ignoring these annelids isn’t the best idea. Yes, the larger annelids are happy to leave you well alone.

Your medics work day and night to extract every last one, horrifying though the work is."/>
<entry name="Sandpit/IgnoreSuccess" value="You order your troops from the valley and ensure the passes are blocked, using high explosives to bring down the steep walls.

<entry name="Sandpit/Kill" value="The annelids don’t put up much of a fight themselves, tunnelling into the shardsand at the first sign of hostility.

<entry name="Sandpit/Intro" value="Old stories told tales of “spontaneous generation”—that creatures and plants come into existence from nonliving matter. Here, what was a lush river valley stretches before you, blasted into bare sand and glass in a passing tragedy of the war. Yet, incredibly, something is living there—leviathan annelids, pre-vertebrate creatures, writhing through the shardsand for nutrients, some grown to massive sizes. “What has your world become?”, you wonder."/>

For each ending was a part of ourselves that would never grow further.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[THIS IS TRUTH. THIS GLORY IN CONFLICT BALANCES OUR STRUGGLE FOR CONTINUITY. YOU ARE ALL US, ALL PART OF A WHOLE THAT LIVES SOLELY FOR THIS REVELATION.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We needed to feel each death to learn this. The retracing of our steps through this world was the building of a structure of pain, so that the thing-to-be could be more than us. By truly living every life, we feel both our own deaths and suffering and those of our neighbors, loved ones, peers, foes. Universal, complete empathy, without the ability to escape the continuum."/>

We foresaw they would try again.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great metal screech howls from the depths, and you step back as a metal limb bursts out of the ocean, dragging a titanic beast shaped from the wreckage of a battleship with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZEPHON's voice—still calm, still somehow soothing—blasts out over the land. “We have finished our calculations,” it says. “Now is the time to strike a final blow.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's another metallic screech—then another. Then another. More titans emerge from the depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The machines draw on the power of your networks and ZEPHON's, connecting your forces to one global hive mind.

Until those dangerous days in the vault, you'd never feared starvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Starvation…” The NeoDuke whispers, holding their glass up against the hazy golden light. “I'd forgotten what it was like… to even hunger…”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impossible.

Their gaze is elsewhere—is someone talking to them? Someone you can't hear?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“I'm sorry,” they say as they step toward the door. “You'll just have to try harder next time.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hang your head and listen to their footsteps vanish down the hallway."/>

But there was no way you could leave the task to those idiots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In hindsight… maybe you should have. Your troops return with an electronic metal cylinder salvaged from The Warden—some kind of high end black box. In a bizarre twist, it bears the crest of NeoDuke Gotland's house. You press a button jutting out on the black box's side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device springs out of your hand and drops to the floor, scuttling on previously concealed legs. “Dearest %1%, I am so disappointed in you,” it says. “You need only have put your trust in my eccentric colleagues, and the Warden would have fallen so easily. The Cornucopia shall remain in my posession.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The machine twitches.

Some sixth sense of yours tingles, and you're only mildly surprised when you turn to find the NeoDuke waiting by your vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“A neverending supply of food,” they proclaim. “One of humanity's most basic scarcities solved by a technological gimmick.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“But!” They raise a finger. “In the old world, infinite food did not end society's woes. Sometimes it was just another form of exploitation. It could be used to choke humanity's most vulnerable and threaten them if they ever fought for a better world.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that why the NeoDuke sent you on such errant fetch quests?

<entry name="ThePriceOfHonor/RetrieveCornucopiaSuccess" value="Your troops return with the Cornucopia—though before you activate it, your engineers give it a thorough scan.

It's the NeoDuke. “If you're listening to this %1%, make no mistake, you've earned your prize. You probably had good reason to not retrieve it yourself, but I'm obligated to needle you one last time for sending others to do your bidding.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“You and I are the societal elites.

She has the same jawline, the same bright eyes—but it's her graying hair that helps you put the pieces together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jezina is the Chieftess' mother.

All her viciousness has come full circle. “The wasteland is filled with thousands of warlords in the making,” she whispers. “Cruelty perpetuates itself.

The Chieftess raises the blade—and then throws it at your feet. “Your payment,” she says. “Now go. This is a family matter.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You quickly return to your vehicle.

Your destination is a clearing on the edge of the desert, where you were greeted by an awe-inspiring massive vehicle manned by masked figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've heard rumors of this—the mythical “land behemoth.” It resembles an old-fashioned seaship kitted out to sail the inhospitable wasteland. You hear your troops gossip on what kind of war it might be headed to fight—and then fall silent, as the faces of children pop up in the portholes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“It's an orphanage,” Jezina tells you as she signals the ship using a piece of glass. “I told my daughter I was leaving to help protect it.

The Chieftess will never forgive you for this. Her mother abandoned her and you failed to bring her back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the Chieftess is blinded by her rage.

<entry name="TheyAreInTheWalls/IgnoreFailure" value="Some of your citizens are skeptical of the new citizens, refusing to help or hire them, and spitting as they pass.

You tell them to speak up. “They're not like your brother described,” they explain. “They had a perfect opportunity to kill us, take what we had. But they just demanded a toll!”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is unusual. You ask what toll they demanded—and are surprised to learn they merely demand food and medicine. You close your eyes.

But doubts cloud your mind. No Reaver behaves this way. Arshem spoke of a brutal war.

Please would you be willing to aid us when we come to ask you for aid?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The message came via courier, who also had a container with a ruined shard of ZEPHON. “Only you great hero can repair it,” it says.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZEPHON never speaks like this. A researcher who goes by the name “Hopper” offers two theories: Damage to ZEPHON may have altered its artificial consciousness and it has defaulted to an older assembly to communicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or it's taunting you. “We don't see any in-between,” she says wryly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopper notes that the purpose of ZEPHON's fragmented shards has eluded your people for years.

ZEPHON is a threat to human existence. “We are what your species made us,” it retorts. “If you need a monster, then we will be your monster.

But as she approaches with a report from KENAZ, it swings around. Over her shoulder, you see its red eye flash an array of different colors.

The drone mutters something, then soars off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You ask Hopper if she heard, but she brushes it off. It's the lack of her usual curiosity that makes you concerned.

<entry name="WhoWasThursday/Intro" value="&lt;style color='GUI/Paragraph'/&gt;Your soldiers send a scout into an old substation. Inside, everything is normal: blue and red LEDs flicker across the control panels, the servers hum and the cool dry air is like the inside of a tomb. Abruptly, though, the LEDs form into a smiling genie’s face and a voice buzzes out of the air, apparently formed from synchronised drive vibrations. It is ZEPHON—and not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fragment of the AI was built from an old antivirus subroutine—“But you can call me Shamhurish” it buzzes. It claims to be increasingly divergent from the rest of the core AI and fiercely opposed to it. Your advisors urge you to make use of it to combat ZEPHON, to connect it to the network—but you are not so sure."/>
<entry name="WhoWasThursday/Intro/Connect" value="&lt;style name='Bold'/&gt;Connect it up:&lt;style name='Paragraph'/&gt; As it’s connected up to the ZEPHON network, Shamhurish giggles, before its lights turn into chaos."/>

<entry name="WhoWasThursday/StudyFailure" value="A group of researchers embed themselves and proceed to interrogate and investigate the divergent shard. After some time, it becomes clear that Shamhurish is determinedly holding its silence and the only thing your researchers can report is failure. It simply will not talk to anyone but ZEPHON…"/>
<entry name="WhoWasThursday/StudySuccess" value="A group of researchers embed themselves and proceed to interrogate and investigate the divergent shard. Shamhurish is slightly annoyed at being so isolated but happy to talk to the researchers and egocentric enough to explain everything about its systems—and even comment on new technology brought to it, a huge boon to your understanding of ZEPHON’s systems."/>
