*“There is no weakness. There is no doubt. There is only service to the God-Emperor and duty and blood. We do our deeds, we endure the galaxy’s horrors, then we die fighting for humanity. Against heretic and mutant and xenos. Until the end of days.”*<br/>
— Canoness Vandire

___

The youngest of humanity’s armies, under 4000 years old, you Adepta Sororitas are the military arm of the Imperium’s state religion, the Ecclesiarchy. You worship the Emperor, enshrined on his Golden Throne, as a god, contrary to his wishes. And in his name, you pursue the faithless and the xenos across the entire galaxy, purging it of the heresy of their being.

However, on Gladius Prime, your Order was unusual. Here, you had a reputation for mercy and kindness, and your non-Militant Orders were even known to help the miserable populations of the Hive Cities.

Little that mattered, though, when half the Xenos in the galaxy were unleashed on this world and your Canoness vanished. Protecting the remaining humans has become secondary to survival and now your prayers have turned from simple worship to desperation—now you pray for a miracle.
