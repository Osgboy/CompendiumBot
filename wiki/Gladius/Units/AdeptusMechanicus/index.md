*“Knowledge is the principal thing; therefore get thee knowledge. And in all your getting, get understanding. The Omnissiah directs us to tread the path of wisdom; if anything blocks our way, be it creature, machine or man, we must sacrifice them to the glory of the Machine God and to the Imperium.”*<br>
— Genetor Choen, Forge Mistress

You of the Adeptus Mechanicus—the Cult of the Machine God—have worshipped the Omnissiah long before the Imperium came to your world of Mars. Following His edict, you have never doubted or ceased to pursue your calling—to gather knowledge and to employ it to gather more. In pursuit of that, you built the devices and machines that enabled the Imperium to conquer the galaxy 10,000 years ago and maintain it today.

So Gladius Prime was your planet more than it was the Imperium’s—what Hive World was not? Its cities, its satellites, its wastes—all were built with Mars’ technology, all answered only to the Adeptus Mechanicus—that is, to you. It was little effort to hide the Adeptus Mechanicus research into the Tyranids here, in a facility deep beneath the ashen wastes.

Now, however, your facility has been compromised, your Skitarii forces scattered and your subjects have escaped. You must rebuild, recover and take Gladius Prime’s secrets for your own. For you have a mission to fulfil, from the Omnissiah himself…
