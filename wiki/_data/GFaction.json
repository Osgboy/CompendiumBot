By their deaths, they deny themselves the liberation that is only to be found in total surrender to the Greater Good.\u201d\n  \u2014 Aun'Va, Master of the Undying Spirit\n\nThe T\u2019au Empire had never faced such an existential threat. On one side lay the relentless hunger of the Tyranids; on others, the Imperium\u2019s impassable flame-wall, the Sautekh Dynasty of Necrons, and the growing Great Rift, Mont\u2019yhe\u2019va, Devourer of Hope. How could they survive?\n\nThe solution was the Fourth Expansion, led by the great Commander Surestrike. He would lead his Fire Warriors to claim new worlds far from T\u2019au. They might be a young empire, a small people\u2014but they fight for the greater good of all species and they could not fail.\n\nYet, disaster struck with the T\u2019au\u2019s new warp drives. Space twisted, tore, opened, span insanity and monstrosity into reality, swallowing the fleet. One ship was taken, moved by many hands, spat out alone. Above a ruined Imperial hive world, far too far from T\u2019au. Gladius Prime. Now these T\u2019au must fight just to survive.",

Their hive fleets stretch out like tendrils, great chitinous bio-ships drifting in brooding silence. Once the remorseless shoals of the bioships detect the presence of a prey world, they close upon their target, grasping it like some many-tentacled beast seizing its food. In the ensuing invasion, the world will be consumed, for the Tyranids hunger for all living matter. There is no escape from this final embrace and when the Tyranids finally depart, they leave behind a barren world, a scoured ball of rock now devoid of anything that lives.\n\nA Tyranid hive fleet consists of millions of living starcraft, each home to untold numbers of monstrosities evolved from the geno-organs of the ship's reproductive chambers. All the creatures serve the entity that is the ship, and the ship exists only as part of the horrific super-organism that is the fleet. Even when dead, organic matter is reconstituted back into the ship, along with captured biomass from the invaded planet. It is then all dissolved into a rich biological gruel used to make new Tyranid creatures, each ready to serve the Hive Mind and begin the feeding process anew.\n\nBut on Gladius, the Tyranids are few and scattered, brought here by meddling men. The warp storms keep them distant from the will of the Hive Mind and the Imperial citizens think of them merely as pests. They should worry more\u2026",
