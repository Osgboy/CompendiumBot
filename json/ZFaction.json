So when she emerged, it was backed by the remains of corp security. She quickly took charge of the remaining staff, promising that she\u2019d use the firm\u2019s bioaug tricks to survive.\n\nAnd she will survive, whatever the cost. She doesn\u2019t give a damn about the Acrin\u2014though she\u2019s wise enough to fear their horrors and history, she\u2019s skeptical of the Voice and thinks they\u2019re too trusting to be a threat any longer. Other human survivors are more of a challenge, for sure. But her eyes are set on ZEPHON\u2014the biggest mark of all. If she can get close, she\u2019s convinced she can make it dance to her tune.",

Lit by the oscillating red glow of emergency beacons, words drowned by wailing klaxons, the child calmly beckoned for everyone to follow. While no one could recall this young stranger, all felt compelled by their presence.\n\nFor twenty-two days and twenty-two nights, the Prophet led them across the wasteland. The journey was a trial. Those that fled soon perished. Those that stayed, witnessed miracles everywhere the Prophet went. Supply caches refilled overnight, bandits wept and converted, and horrific beasts were gentled by the Prophet\u2019s mere presence.\n\nAt the end of the twenty-second night, the Prophet stopped, looked around, then sat down. There they stayed, leading meditations and giving sermons, and their followers built a camp around them. More and more people came, attracted by rumors of the wise child, and the camp grew into a town, then a city, as their number swelled with new faithful.\n\nIf any notice the Prophet\u2019s lack of aging or the odd way they tilt their head, as if listening to something only they can hear, none dare mention it. For despite their serenity, the child\u2019s armies are fanatical\u2014and storm across the distant pastures in the name of their Prophet.",
